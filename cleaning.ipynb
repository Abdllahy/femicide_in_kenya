         "On August 12, 2005 at around 7pm, Joyce Gacheri and her grandson Amos Murega were in her home in Gaintume Village, Meru County preparing dinner.A few minutes later, Gacheri's daughter-in-law Dorcas Kaguri arrived from Meru town with luggage. She left the items with her son Murega saying she was going to buy paraffin from the local shopping centre. However, when Kaguri came back, about 30 minutes later, she was visibly drunk and was staggering around the compound.Kaguri's husband Julius Koome, who had been working on the farm all day, was preparing dinner for his children when his drunk wife arrived home from town. He was not amused by his wife's state and a quarrel ensured between the couple, which quickly degenerated into a physical fight. Gacheri and Murega's efforts to calm the two was futile and when Koome stuck his wife, Gacheri tried to pull them apart and requested them not to fight at her home.The irate Koome then grabbed a metallic pipe and hammer like object which he used to strike Kaguri who fell to the ground. He then started kicking her even though she did not fight back at this point.Gacheri and Murega sought refuge and assistance from a neighbour Patrick Kibuu who told them to inform the village elder, which they did.Murega returned home at around 9pm and did not find his mother at the home. The following day, Kaguri was found dead at Gacheri's doorstep and Koome was immediately arrested and arraigned in court for the murder of his wife.He denied the charges saying while he confronted his wife, he only threatened to beat her up and she fled before he did.The trial court, however, found Koome guilty of murder and sentenced him to death.He appealed the decision but on June 24, 2016, Nyeri Court of Appeal judges Phillip Waki, Roselyn Nambuye and Patrick Kiage dismissed his appeal.The judges noted that Koome was the last person to see Kaguri alive and he could not account for his whereabouts between 7pm and 9pm.",

Accused to be sentenced on November 6, says judge The High Court has convicted a 34-year-old man after finding him guilty of raping and murdering his grandmother. Wilson Masiko Mungasia killed Selina Ikambi Anasi,79, on February 10, 2011, at their Mituri village home in Kakamega East. Ikambi, a herbalist, was reported missing on February 9. She lived in the same compound with the accused. Family members said Masiko could not state where the victim was and did not participate in the search. Your opinion is valuable. Take this quick survey to help us improve the website and content Julietta Musee told court he was the last person seen entering Ikambi's house before she went missing. The court heard that family members later stumbled on Ikambi's body in a sugarcane plantation. It had been wrapped in a blanket. Her killer had stuffed her mouth with pieces of blanket. A used male condom still embedded in her genitals. ALSO READ:\n \n Kakamega man convicted for murdering grandmother Government pathologist Dixon Mchana told court the victim had a deep cut on her forehead. Dr Mchana concluded the cause of death was head injury. He also said there was evidence of sexual assault. Justice Ruth Sitati said the prosecution had proved the case of murder against Masiko beyond any reasonable doubt. Justice Sitati noted Masiko fled after his grandmother's body was recovered, only to re-appear for her burial, five days later. Alhough the prosecution relied on consequential evidence, since there was no eye-witness, the judge said the evidence was sufficient to place the accused at the centre of the felony. \"The accused is the one who lived with the deceased and when she disappeared, he was seen coming out of her house. When he was asked about her whereabouts, he spoke with a certain degree of certainty, that she had gone to treat some children,\" Justice Sitati said in her judgement read by Justice William Musyoka. She added: \"In my view, he had a duty and in his own interest, to explain how she died. Having failed to do so, the only inference this court can make is that he knew she had died.\" ALSO READ:\n \n Isiolo Imam accused of raping 16-year-old schoolgirl \"From the analysis, I find that the accused is guilty of murder and convict him accordingly,\" the judge said.

         "Former journalist Moses Dola Otieno yesterday claimed that his wife Wambui Kabiru died after hitting her head on a bed. Dola yesterday told the court that a quarrel over music volume left his wife and former NTV reporter dead. In an emotional blow-by-blow account, the former Nation journalist narrated the events of May 1, 2011. Dola explained, that on the material day, he woke up at 7.30am, headed to the sitting room and started playing some gospel music which beamed in all rooms. He then went back to the bedroom where Wambui was sleeping and she allegedly questioned why he put loud music while she and their son were asleep. \"That was where the problem began. Wambui had a problem with the music and she said in Kiswahili 'Wewe ukiamka kwa hii nyumba kwani kila mtu lazima aamke (If you wake up in this house, is it a must that every one else wakes up?),\" Dola narrated. ALSO READ: Boy, 12, found guilty of murdering 'girlfriend' in Nakuru He said Wambui then went to the sitting room, unplugged the music system and came back to the bed room. \"I felt a little bit irritated. I went back and restarted the music and reduced the volume further,\" he said. According to Dola, Wambui was using a metallic pair of scissors to trim the edges of her dreadlocks when he returned to the bedroom. The two quarreled, and Dola decided to take their son, who had just woken up, away. Dola testified that Wambui then went after him with the pair of scissors. \"Just as I was picking our son, she shot up and charged at me. She asked where I wanted to take her baby. In her charging she was holding that metallic scissors. It was a split second event. Unfortunately it pricked my hand but I managed to squeeze her hand and she released it,\" Dola testified while showing his palm to show where he got stabbed. The judge was told that Wambui reached for the scissors but Dola tackled her, and they both fell on the bed. ALSO READ: Murder of aspirants children blamed on family feud He testified: \"She hit her head on the bed, but because we fell on the mattress I did not realise that she was injured.\" According to Dola, his wife's last words were \"ona umeniumiza\" (see you have hurt me). He then took their son for breakfast and left her in bed. According to Dola, he went to his brother in law's house in a bid to seek a truce with his wife. After that both Wambui's brother and Dola went to drink. He testified that he was to take his bother in law to a baby shower later in the evening and thus they parted ways and he headed back to the house to freshen up. When he got to the house, the court heard, Wambui was still lying in bed and did not respond when he called her name. ALSO READ: Murder of aspirants children blamed on family feud",

         "Musa Wekesa A pastor from Kitale has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for defiling and later killing a high school student who was pregnant with triplets in 2011. While passing the judgement, Justice Hillary Chemitei said evidence presented before the court established that pastor Charles Nyachwara, who served at Yuya Pentecostal Assemblies of God, was guilty of killing the minor with an intention of maintaining his status in the community. \"I have heard litigation by both the Prosecution and Defence sides. What is evident is that the minor suffered a cruel death in your hands. You have a right of appeal,\" said Justice Chemitei while delivering the judgment. Pastor Nyachwara is said to have stabbed Scholastica Mmbihi to death using a kitchen knife on July 7, 2011 in a bid to end a court tussle between him and the girl's family after he defiled and impregnated her. The family of the Yuya Secondary School student had launched criminal proceedings against the pastor after he impregnated their daughter. Nyachwara confessed to killing the girl to protect his priestly image after his efforts to settle the matter with the family out of court was unfruitful. \"I wish to state that I killed her because his father was not prepared to withdraw a defilement charge against me at Kitale law courts,\" said the pastor. Postmortem reports submitted in the court earlier revealed that the deceased was pregnant with triplets. The girl's father, Paul Mmbihi, who has waited for long for justice said he will not appeal the judgment.",

         "A father who killed his wife nine years ago after he found her having sex with another man in the bush will continue serving his 20-year sentence. The appellate court threw out his appeal. Mdoe Kombe was sentenced and convicted in 2018 on the lesser offence of manslaughter after the High Court found that he indeed killed his wife Kwekwe Nyanje. Kombe had been charged with murdering Kwekwe on October 4, 2011, at about 4pm in Majugwani village, Mwereni location, Kwale county. Kombe had admitted to having killed his wife. However, he stated that it was because he had found her having sex with another man in a bush. He allegedly chased the man and his wife escaped to her parents' home, where he had found her and eventually stabbed her to death. The trial court in its judgment ruled that the husband was provoked into committing the offence. It convicted him of manslaughter rather than the murder he had been charged with, going ahead to sentence him to 20 years behind bars. He appealed, arguing that the judge erred in law by failing to see that nobody testified to have witnessed seeing him at the alleged scene of crime killing his wife, which he later withdrew and stuck to appealing the sentence. He challenged the sentence, arguing that counsel asserted that the sentence was harsh and excessive. Counsel also said after he was convicted, the appellant had stated in mitigation that he was a first offender, was now a single parent, and had shown remorse, and prayed for leniency. However, Justices DK Musinga, Gatembu Kairu and Agnes Murgor dismissed his arguments on sentence, ruling they had no jurisdiction to entertain appeals on the severity of the sentence. \"Bearing this in mind, we are of the view that the learned judge took into account the facts of the case, and more particularly the appellant's probation report, and exercising of his discretion, sentenced the appellant to 20 years' imprisonment,\" the court ruled. \"As such, we have no reason to interfere with the sentence imposed.\" During the trial of the case at the High Court, Kombe's father-in-law had testified that his late daughter and Kombe had an understanding that she went back home. Kombe allegedly followed her to their home to resolve the misunderstanding, but when his father-in-law went to call the elders to settle the dispute, he was called by his wife and told that his daughter had been stabbed. \"On his return, he found that the appellant had left the home and his daughter was lying in a pool of blood with a huge cut wound on her neck,\" court papers read.",

         "A court has recommended that former TV news anchor Louis Otieno be subjected to fresh tests to establish whether he was involved in the murder of Careen Chepchumba, his girlfriend who was murdered six years ago. Ms Careen was found dead inside her apartment at Santonia Court, Kilimani, on February 12, 2012, and after investigations police said they did not have a suspect. PUBLIC INQUEST Accusing police of bungling the investigations and recommending a public inquest, former Kibera Resident magistrate Charles Ondiek urged the Director of Public Prosecutions to direct fresh probe to resolve the murder of Careen. Mr Otieno denied killing Ms Careen or ever having a romantic affair with her. He however admitted that she was his friend. \"The cause of Careen's death was not suicide, it was not accidental. The cause of death of Careen Chepchumba Kili can not be said to be undetermined. The cause was strangulation. These are inevitable findings,\" the court stated. The court found that police exonerated Mr Otieno of involvement in the murder even before carrying forensic analysis of his phones and of the deceased to establish where he was at the time Careen was murdered. \"Having found no eye witness, forensic evidence was the sure key to unlock criminal culpability by some known person or persons. In fact, this investigation was hinged and turned on a composite of two key evidence namely forensic and circumstantial,\" the inquest found. It follows that in the absence of forensic evidence and having not considered the circumstantial evidence, the far-reaching conclusion by the team of investigators that there was no evidence to support a theory of murder was hollow, devoid of merit and thus clearly unfounded, the court observed. It has recommended that samples of Mr Otieno's finger nails be taken in the presence of Head of Government Chemist who shall take them immediately after documentation by police. The inquest was told how nail clippings taken by police from Otieno turned out to be of Careen during analysis by experts at the Government Chemist. The court directed that the mix up of the clippings be investigated too. The vehicle was repossessed by the dealer and later sold to recover the debt.",

         "In late 2009, James Mulu Mulewa, then aged 21, met 19-year-old Mercy Muthethya Ngali in Mathare North, Nairobi. James was dazzled by Mercy's skin, smile and hair, and decided to ask for friendship from the thing of beauty. Mercy obliged and since they both worked in the city centre, they started meeting over coffee and hanging out on weekends. Soon, the strong wave love swept them off their feet and for two and a half years, they referred to each other \"my love\". By the start of 2012, their bond had grown so strong that James, then 23, wanted to take the relationship to the next level. But deep down his heart, all was not all. SEXUAL DESIRE While they were closer than close, he was frustrated that the girl he loved and gave his all had refused to get intimate with him. He had employed all the tricks in the dating book to no avail and this made him very angry. Unable to think with his head, his sexual desire drove him down the road of ruin. On Monday, February 27, 2012, James and Mercy rose and rushed to work in CBD as usual. In the evening, the two love birds boarded the same matatu to Mathare North and on alighting, James insisted on accompanying his love to her home. She caved in to his pressure and they both walked to her mother's house. There was no one home and upon entering the house, James saw an opportunity: He demanded for sex. Like she had done over and over again, Mercy said no. But James could hear none of it. ATTACK He grabbed her, pushed her into her mother's bed and attempted to rape her, the High Court in Nairobi ruled on Friday after finding him guilty of murdering the young woman who was full of life. According to state prosecutor Charles Okeyo, James tore his fiancee's underpants as he forced her to have sex. When he failed to satisfy his desire, the prosecutor said, James became wild and in a fit of fury he pulled a knife from his pocket and stabbed her 16 times. Overpowered and defenceless, Mercy screamed attracting the attention of neighbours. James refused to open the door, compelling the alarmed neighbours to call police officers who were on patrol. On arrival, police ordered him to open the door or else they force their way in. With trembling hands and quaking in his shoes, the man who had done the unthinkable opened the door. On the bed, the lifeless body of Mercy lay in a pool of blood, and on the floor, was the murder weapon-- knife. \"Mulu (James) viciously attacked the defenceless woman whom he had laid in her mother's bed,\" Justice Roselyn Korir said in her conviction. \"Mulu assaulted his would-be wife by stabbing her six times in her private parts, six times in her lower abdomen, one time in her liver twice in her thighs and once in her buttocks.\" She said the murder could only have been committed by the accused since he was the only person who was with Mercy moments before her death. The judge said the accused committed a heinous act of pouring anger on an innocent girl who lost her precious life at a tender age. Having secured a successful conviction, Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has only one request to the court: hand down the mandatory death sentence to this man. Mr Okeyo, the state prosecutor representing Mr Haji, on Friday urged Justice Korir \"to have no mercy\" on James who killed Mercy without provocation. He said James' date with the hangman would serve as a warning to men who have no respect for women and human life. But in his mitigation, a subdued James pleaded for leniency, saying he has reformed and has even pursued theological studies while in remand prison. The judge will visit the scene of the murder before passing her sentence on December 5. Harry Misiko contributed to this report.",

         "A former city pastor convicted of killing his alleged mistress eight years ago has lost his appeal. Pastor Paul Ng'ang'a of Well of Faith Ministries in Gatina Kawangware was found guilty of the 2012 murder of Carolyne Chanjirah. Ng'ang'a was charged alongside keyboard player James Muia, who was later acquitted after his testimony helped the court to convict the cleric. Court of Appeal judges Mohammed Warsame, Kathurima M'inoti and Sankale Ole Kantai ruled that the appeal had no merit. The court ruled that the High Court was right to convict Ng'ang'a for the murder based on the evidence presented. \"...we do not see any gaps in the prosecution case that would have undermined the appellant's conviction, nor do we find any bias on the part of the learned judge,\" the court ruled. Court documents showed Ng'ang'a assaulted Chanjirah inside his car at around 8pm on the night of the incident. At Lenana area, Chanjirah flagged down a KK Security vehicle and the guards rescued her. She showed them the pastor's vehicle, which was parked close by. She died later from her injuries. Muia testified that he was with the pastor in the car with the woman. She kept asking how the pastor could neglect his child, he said. The Appeal Court ruled that the conduct of the pastor and the nature of the injuries inflicted on Chanjirah indicated that he intended to kill or inflict grievous injuries on her. \"The deceased succumbed to her injuries within a few hours of the assault and we are therefore satisfied that the prosecution proved malice aforethought on the part of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt,\" the court noted. The judges said the attempt to strangle Chanjirah, the severe blunt force injuries on the head and which killed her all demonstrate the cleric's intent. \"If motive can be drawn from facts, then the evidence of Muia that the deceased was querying what kind of man the appellant was for failing to support his own child, could readily have supplied the motive,\" the court ruled. They ruled that Ng'ang'a fleeing from the scene after excusing himself to go and lock his car was not consistent with his innocence. The pastor claimed in mitigation that he was carjacked at the Junction Mall while in the company of Muia. He said Chanjirah was part of the gang that attacked him and she had blood when she entered his car. However, the judges questioned the heavy staining of his clothes with her blood, the presence of her blood on many parts of the car, including as far as the inside rear roof and on the murder weapon recovered at the scene.",

         "A former banker, who was found guilty of killing his girlfriend, was on Wednesday sentenced to 25 years in prison the High Court in Kitale. The court heard that Samson Kamau Njoroge murdered Alice Wangui Kamau and dumped her body in a borehole in his compound in May 2012 in Naisambu to evade her demands for child support. On the fateful night, Mr Kamau had attended a court case where the deceased wanted him to be compelled to take care of a son born in 2008 as a result of their secret relationship. The deceased went missing and sent distress calls to her family indicating that she had been kidnapped and was being raped repeatedly prompting a search by police. HEINOUS CRIME \"She sent me a text on my phone saying she had been kidnapped and was being raped by the kidnapper,\" Wangui's aunt Eunice Wairimu told the court. Mr Kamau's maid Veronica Njeri told the court that her employer did not spend the night at home on the fateful day. He arrived arrive early in the morning and sent her to the shop. \"When I came back I found him washing clothes which I never saw him do during my two-year stay at the homestead. He later washed his car and left for work without his vehicle as was his norm,\" said Ms Njeri. DENIAL In his defence, Mr Kamau denied involvement in the murder saying the reason he did not spend the night at his homestead on the fateful night was because he was very drunk and could not drive. \"I went home in the morning and decided to wash my clothes since they were very muddy. My maid informed me that police officers were looking for me when I left for work,\" said Mr Kamau. In his judgement, Justice Hillary Chemitei said circumstantial evidence tabled before court had linked Mr Kamau to the heinous act since Ms Wangui's body was retrieved in his compound. \"The police report indicated that the accused's vehicle had blood stains. Who could gain courage to dump the body in his compound's borehole without being noticed?\" stated the judgment.",

         "A court in Machakos on Wednesday acquitted a man accused of killing his ex-wife outside a disco in Mwala. Justice David Kemei said the evidence presented in court was based on suspicion and not sufficient to prove the accused committed the offence. \"The evidence taken as a whole clearly shows the accused was the ex-husband of the deceased and that they were not on good terms,\" the judge said. KMM as identified in court was accused of killing his ex-wife who worked as a barmaid at Up London bar in Mwala, Machakos county, on Christmas day of 2012. He denied the charges asserting that he had not seen his ex-wife on the said date as he spent the day with a friend in his house. Peter Musau told court that the deceased had been his barmaid and that the accused had been his neighbour. He testified that the accused used to frequent the bar to harass the deceased and often issued threats against her after they had separated and that he used to assign one of his workers to be escorting her to her room to avert any possible incidents. \"On the material day, the deceased informed him that the accused had come into the bar and taken drinks without paying. She later that night told me that KMM was pestering her to accompany him to a disco,\" Musau said. He confirmed that the accused had married the deceased and they had two children but that the marriage was rocked with squabbles. \"One time I had accompanied EKN to a police station to lodge report of assault on her by the accused,\" he testified. Peter Muthuku,who worked as a night guard at Mwala market testified that on December 25, 2012, he heard some noise near a disco. He joined his workmate and approached a nearby tree where they found EKN lying on the ground with a stab wound on her neck. Winfred Ndinda testified that on the material day while on patrol, she was alerted by noise at Mwala market and rushed there to find a woman lying under a tree with a kitchen knife stuck in her neck. Elishper Mwikali of Ngelani police post told the court that on the same date at 4.30am, she was at the post when the accused turned up and introduced himself and reported that he had had a disagreement with somebody whom he had stabbed in the neck. The confession was disregarded in court as the police failed to take down a confession statement according to the law. Doctor Fredrick Okinyi said the postmortem examination showed the body had multiple stab wounds in the neck and left chest wall. \"I concluded that the cause of death was hemorrhagic shock due to stab wound to the heart and lungs,\" he said. The accused, in his defence told the court, he was at home with one Joshua Wambua who used to work at a hotel in Mwala market. \"I had presented myself to the station after hearing the news and accusations but I was arrested and forced to confess to killing EKN. KMM said he was placed in the same vehicle as the deceased where he was assaulted causing him to fall on the body of the deceased thus explaining the bloodstains on his t-shirt. \"I loved her and could not kill her. She would visit me at my place every often,\" he said. In his ruling, Justice Kemei said although the accused is stated to have confessed to have committed the offence, there is no independent evidence that points towards his participation. \"The mere fact that the two knew each other and had frequent disagreements does not amount to proof of culpability. I therefore acquit the accused,\" he ruled.",

But that also never happened after the court consigned her to jail. \n \n On June 30, 2013, Susan had attended Sunday service alongside her two sisters at Full Gospel Church in Mai Mahiu, only for her not to return home or to be seen alive again. \n \n if (shouldRenderAd(false)) {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function () {\n \n googletag.display(\"desktop-article-ad-1\");\n \n });\n \n // Initial load (before ad refresh)\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 5000);\n \n setInterval(function refreshAds() {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {\n \n googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-1']]);\n \n });\n \n // During ad refresh\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.classList.remove('center-align-ad');\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 2000);\n \n }, 90000);\n \n }\n \n Her disfigured body was found the following day in an open field with stab wounds on the head and in the neck region. \n \n The torso (upper part of the body) appeared to have been extensively scalded, either by being burnt or by corrosive substances. \n \n Crime of passion \n \n The body was half naked, with only some fragments of her clothing on the body. \n \n \"The murder was a crime of passion. The accused pretended to be uninvolved and put forth a defence that was found to be flimsy and fictitious,\" trial judge Richard Mwongo said. \n \n \"It was a cruel and cleverly schemed murder,\" added the judge. \n \n At the time of her death, Susan was on vacation and employed at a firm owned by Mr Peter Chege Kabura, who was a friend of one Simon Kibarabara - Waruguru's husband and the alleged lover of the deceased. \n \n Susan allegedly worked as a broker in the real estate field before going to university. \n \n Mr Kibarabara was himself in the real estate business while his wife Waruguru used to operate a shop and MPESA business in Maai Mahiu town. \n \n Susan's family and that of Waruguru lived in King'ori estate and were friends. In fact, Waruguru and Susan related well and were close friends. \n \n if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function () {\n \n googletag.display(\"mobile-article-ad-2\");\n \n });\n \n // Initial load (before ad refresh)\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 5000);\n \n setInterval(function refreshAds() {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {\n \n googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);\n \n });\n \n // During ad refresh\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.classList.remove('center-align-ad');\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 2000);\n \n }, 90000);\n \n }\n \n On June 30, 2013, Susan accompanied her sisters to Full Gospel Church, Mai Mahiu. After church, the sisters were joined by the househelp, Ms Njeri Ndungu, and all proceeded to a restaurant known as GMT Guest House for lunch. \n \n Once at the hotel, their order took too long and Susan was growing impatient. \n \n Death trap \n \n She requested to be served what was ready. After the meal, she left the party at about 4pm, saying she had been called by Waruguru to view some boutique merchandise. \n \n  The said beauty items, which included a beaded purse, were at Waruguru's home. \n \n As she was rushing to Waruguru's home to view the beauty products, little did Susan know that she was being lured to a death trap. \n \n \"The evidence pointed to her having cunningly lured the deceased to her death. The motive attributed to the planned murder was that the deceased was engaged in a romantic affair with the accused's husband, Simon Kibarabara,\" said Justice Mwongo. \n \n Before she left, Susan and her sisters agreed they would let her know once they got back home, as she was travelling to Nairobi later that day. \n \n Several phone calls to her number, however, went unanswered. Eventually, the phone stopped ringing. \n \n One of the sisters, Ms Mary Nyambura, then rang Waruguru to inquire on Susan's whereabouts. However, Waruguru denied asking Susan over to her home. \n \n However, after the body was found, she admitted communicating with the deceased. \n \n Ms Nyambura said after the body was collected by police officers, Waruguru, just like other neighbours, visited the bereaved family. \n \n Ms Nyambura, however, questioned her on her last moments with the deceased. \n \n \"When I questioned her, she said when she got the call from Susan, she had promised to call her back 15 minutes later, as she was in a noisy place. She further said she had not called her back. She showed me her phone... and excused herself to go attend to her baby,\" said Ms Nyambura. \n \n Mobile phone data collected by police investigators showed that Susan related very closely with Waruguru's husband.

Immediately after the cruel murder, Waruguru ceased all contact with Susan's telephone. \n \n An examination of the call log data, for instance, showed Waruguru's husband had on June 20, 2013, made five calls and sent messages to Susan between 7.30am and 7.46pm. \n \n The data further indicated that, on the same day, Waruguru's husband had seven calls with his wife (Waruguru), most of which were initiated by her. \n \n However, most of the calls between Susan and Kibarabara were initiated by the latter and lasted long. One call between the two lasted more than 800 seconds, as compared to those he had Waruguru, which were brief. The longest with Waruguru on that day lasted only 23 seconds. \n \n if (shouldRenderAd(false)) {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function () {\n \n googletag.display(\"desktop-article-ad-2\");\n \n });\n \n // Initial load (before ad refresh)\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 5000);\n \n setInterval(function refreshAds() {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {\n \n googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-2']]);\n \n });\n \n // During ad refresh\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.classList.remove('center-align-ad');\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 2000);\n \n }, 90000);\n \n }\n \n The phone data further showed that on June 22, eight calls were exchanged between Waruguru and her husband from 10.33am to 9.44pm, the longest lasting 112 seconds. \n \n On the other hand, the first call between Susan and Waruguru's husband was at 9.33am, followed by a further 10 calls, the last at 6.52pm and the longest taking 161 seconds. \n \n According to the evidence, Waruguru's husband and Susan appeared to have been together in Kiambu from the evening of June 22 to the early afternoon of June 23, 2013. \n \n That could have explained why, unlike in the previous days, only two calls were exchanged between Mr Kibarabara and Susan. \n \n \"Business associate or not, the accussed's husband was a married man; what business was so pressing that he allowed long and intermittent phone communication with a single young lady at odd hours in the morning, night and all day, while communicating by phone rather briefly, if at all, with his wife?\" posed justice Mwongo. \n \n The call data further shows June 29 was also an active day for Susan and Waruguru's husband. \n \n Exhibits adduced in court reflected 19 calls between Susan and Kibarabara, the first and longest one at 8:54am (lasting 1,296 seconds) and throughout the day until 8:24pm (the latter lasting 96 seconds). \n \n if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function () {\n \n googletag.display(\"mobile-article-ad-4\");\n \n });\n \n // Initial load (before ad refresh)\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 5000);\n \n }\n \n In contrast, only two calls were made between the accused and her husband on that date, the longest lasting 20 seconds. \n \n \"And although the deceased's sisters confirm that the accused and the deceased had a friendship, it is interesting that the call logs between June 20 and June 30, 2013 record three SMSs and one call on June 25, one call on June 28, two calls and an SMS on June 29 and on June 30 four SMSs exchanged between 3.25pm and 4.15pm,\" said Justice Mwongo. \n \n Waruguru wanted a non-custodial sentence, but Justice Mwongo said that would have passed the wrong message to many thousands of women and men stuck up in situations where their spouses are in romantic affairs with girlfriends and boyfriends, commonly called \"mpango wa kando\". \n \n \"A non-custodial sentence may even trigger the idea that murder is fashionable and rewarding - that it is an appropriate cure for mpango wa kando. The answer to this time-immemorial malady cannot be murder,\" said Justice Mwongo. \n \n He added: \"The answer lies not in the liquidation of the third party but in the management of the deviant spouse. That is the message that ought to be communicated.\" \n \n During the entire murder trial and even after been found guilty, Waruguru maintained her innocence. \n \n After her sentencing, her two lawyers told the court Waruguru was \"sorrowful\" and \"very remorseful for the offence\". \n \n Justice Mwongo noted the Probation Officer's report, however, stated as follows on the attitude of the offender to the offence: \"The offender says she did not commit the offence.\" \n \n \"Here, I sense contradiction and insincerity, rather than remorse,\" said the judge. The probation officer had recommended a non-custodial sentence, pointing out that if granted, the accused would need comprehensive rehabilitation including mental health care through a psychiatrist to deter recidivism to such violent crime. \n \n In her defence under oath, Waruguru said on the fateful Sunday, she had gone to church and in the evening she attended a pre-wedding meeting at PCEA Church Maai Mahiu. \n \n if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function () {\n \n googletag.display(\"mobile-article-ad-5\");\n \n });\n \n // Initial load (before ad refresh)\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 5000);\n \n }\n \n She said Susan had visited her shop some two weeks earlier and requested that a hand-made beaded purse like hers (Waruguru's) be ordered for her. \n \n She further said they had spoken on phone on June 28 and 29 and Waruguru informed her that the purse had been made. \n \n But the court noted that none of those who were with Waruguru on the afternoon of June 30, neither the guests nor the hosts of the alleged pre-wedding party at the PCEA church were called to testify in her defence. \n \n Waruguru said she learned about the discovery of the body early the next day as she did her chores. She said she then went to confirm the report and saw people huddled around the scene. Shortly after, she bumped into the deceased's sister, Ms Nyambura and their househelp, Ms Njeri Ndung'u, and followed them to their home. \n \n if (shouldRenderAd(false)) {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function () {\n \n googletag.display(\"desktop-article-ad-3\");\n \n });\n \n // Initial load (before ad refresh)\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 5000);\n \n setInterval(function refreshAds() {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {\n \n googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-3']]);\n \n });\n \n // During ad refresh\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.classList.remove('center-align-ad');\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 2000);\n \n }, 90000);\n \n }\n \n When she returned to the home the following day, she got alarmed at the conduct of the bereaved family towards her and left, never returning. \n \n She asserted that while she was aware that her husband knew the deceased, she did not know they had an affair. \n \n She stated that she thought the two collaborated in real estate business, as her husband engaged in that business, while the deceased acted as a broker. \n \n She further said she knew that during one transaction between the two, her husband had lost some money to fraudsters, who were arrested and charged. \n \n She said Susan had been a key witness in the case and that the fraud suspects had also been arrested in connection with Susan's murder, but were later released.

         "A man has been found guilty of murdering his wife. The court heard that Isaac Kirui beat and forced Damaris Kibe to take poison. Kirui was convicted by High Court judge Justus Bwonwonga after the prosecution proved he committed the offence. He will be sentenced in two weeks' time. Kirui was charged in 2013. The prosecution called five witnesses in the case. Lucy Ntutu, their landlord, testified that the two lived together in a one-room house as husband and wife. Damaris's body was found covered with a blanket in bed. A postmortem revealed that her stomach had semi-digested material with tiny white particles. Pathologist Titus Ngulungu said the mucosa in the genito-urinary system appeared hemorrhagic. And her head had a bruise. The cause of death was due to chemical poisoning and gastritis. The large bruise at the back of the head was due to blunt trauma, he said. Organophosphate pesticide was found in the samples sent to the government analyst. The chemical is used to kill pests. When ingested by humans, it blocks neuron transmission and causes paralysis of the heart and lungs, leading to death. During cross-examination, Ngulungu said the poison was orally administered. \"Usually, people who commit suicide do not have other injuries. According to the doctor, the injuries suggested forced ingestion and the injury on the body of the deceased was inflicted before death,\" he said. Douglas Angima, the security assistant at the residence, said Damaris told him she had disagreements with her husband and needed their help. He waited for his chairman to return so they could help. By the time the chairman came back, however, the woman had died. Police officer Thomas Mwinga said he was informed of a fight at 7am. He then proceeded to the crime scene where he found Damaris dead. Kirui was on the spot and had a bottle of insecticide. He told the officer Damaris had poisoned herself. He was taken to a police post. \"A group of people wanted to beat the accused. As a result, the officer took him to their office. There was a curtain sheet that divided the one-room house into a bedroom and a sitting room, which was bloodstained,\" Mwinga said. In his defence, Kirui had said the deceased was his girlfriend. He said that on November 3, 2013, he went to Transmara West to bring roofing grass. As he returned, he got a call from Damaris. She was crying but declined to explain her problem, he said. On reaching his house, he found Damaris, who, he said, appeared drunk. He said she worked at Equator Pub. He went to bed. At about 3am, the accused woke up and cried again saying she was dying. He tried to assist her but she fell down and got injured, Kirui said. The judge disagreed. He said the postmortem report disclosed that she died after poisoning and attack. \"In the circumstances, I find that the evidence discloses murder and not manslaughter,\" he ruled. \"The upshot of the foregoing is that I find the accused is guilty of murder and therefore convict him of murder contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code.\" (Edited by F'Orieny)",

On Thursday, Kericho High Court Judge Lady Justice Mumbi Ngugi ruled that there was sufficient evidence proving the accused committed the offense. The prosecution put on the stand seven witnesses to prove the case. The prosecution told the court that the two are said to have been married for more than 21 years but on the fateful day, the accused and his late wife had arrived home from church.

         "A former university student has been found guilty of killing his lover.Marcel Jumanne Dalance, who is awaiting a probation report before sentencing, was found to have had a hand in the death of Faith Vicky Owuor on the night of July 10 and 11, 2014 in Juja.Dalance and Vicky were First Year students at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). The two shared a room in Alpha House – one of the many hostels outside the campus.It was here that Vicky died in a fire her lover claimed was caused by an electrical fault. Dalance's alibi was that he was with two friends when the incident occurred.But this was no accident as shown by an SMS Vicky sent her friend Mildred Owando, a Fourth Year student at the University of Nairobi.“Tables zimeturn (the tables have turned) Marcel and I are done for good. Wha, vitu zimekuwa moto, nitakwambia story, anataka kuniua (Wah, things are hot! I will tell you the story, he wants to kill me),” she texted Owando.This was a vital thread in the prosecution's case that compelled Justice James Wakiaga to find that Dalance was linked to Vicky's death.\"The victim's dying declaration further proved circumstantial evidence linking the accused to the death and irresistibly point to his guilt. I have looked at the accused person's defence in which he attempted to raise an alibi defence to the effect that he was not with the deceased at the time when the fire broke out and that he only came back and found the room on fire.\"However, it is clear from the evidence tendered that the accused was unable to account for his whereabouts from 10pm, when he parted ways with defence witnesses two and three,” ruled Justice Wakiaga.The State called 13 witnesses, who included fellow students and Vicky's relatives. It was police investigator E Mwangangi's testimony that the suspect's account of what happened did not add up.The court heard that Dalance told Mwangangi that Vicky's mobile phone got burnt yet he still had it. The suspect claimed he had left his lover making tea yet the kettle was not on, and a gas cylinder had not exploded.The investigator also determined that the position of Vicky's body showed she had not attempted to escape from the burning room. This, he concluded, meant she had been killed before the room was set on fire.",

         "A man found guilty of murdering his fiancee got relief after the Court of Appeal in Kisumu reduced his life sentence to 25 years. A three-judge bench upheld the conviction of Enock Akoko but instead sentenced him to 25 years as from 2015, the year he was convicted. Akoko was found guilty of murdering Janet Awuor, a Maasai Mara University student on the night of September 19, 2014 at Highway Complex Lodge in Migori county. Akoko's age -- 35 -- and the mitigation showing he had been remorseful for the five years he has spent in custody were considered in the ruling. \"Accordingly, whereas we dismiss the appeal on conviction, we nonetheless allow the appeal on sentence. In lieu of the sentence, the appellant shall serve imprisonment term of 25 years,\" Justice Patrick Kiage ruled. Through his lawyer, Akoko argued his earlier conviction and life sentence were wrong as the court relied on the evidence of a single witness. On September 20, 2014, the deceased, 19 years, travelled to Migori town in the company of her boyfriend and spent the night with him at the Highway Complex Lodge. Her dead body was found in the hotel's room on the morning of September 22, 2014 by the hotel's manager who was on duty. On close observation of the body, she noticed a stab wound on the neck and traces of blood around the nose and the mouth. She headed toward the room after noticing flies and a foul smell emanating from one of the rooms drew her attention. She called the receptionist. The receptionist revealed that a man, who had only identified himself as Otieno O. had booked the room on September 19, 2014. When asked for his identity card, he told her that he had forgotten it but he gave her an ID number Items found in the room included a leather bag, syringes, empty alcohol bottles and other personal belongings of the deceased. Police officers were notified of the dead body and afterwards traced the accused person and arrested him. An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was severe bleeding in the chest cavity caused by a penetrating lung injury. In his defence, Akoko said that although he knew where the lodge was, he did not sleep there at any time. His father, however, testified that a day before the incident, Akoko had brought a woman at home, had supper and thereafter left, saying they were going to spend the night in town. \"He (Akoko) admitted he knew the deceased as his fiancee. He recalled that the last time he was with her was in August 2014, when her father caused them to be arrested when he found them in his house,\" court documents read. Edited by E.Kibii",

         "Gavel on desk [Courtesy] A 47-year-old woman who was found guilty of killing her neighbour over allegations of having an affair with her husband has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Agnes Cherono was convicted of killing Margaret Kobilo on December 15, 2014, at their home in Chegilet, Iten in Uasin Gishu County after hitting her with a jembe before dumping her body in a nearby millet farm. During the delivery of the sentence, High Court judge Eric Ogola warned that no one should take the law into his own hands. \"The accused may have been provoked by allegations that the deceased was having an affair with her husband. However, the accused had no right to kill the deceased on that ground. Nobody should take the law into their hands and get away with it. This court must send a clear message that life is sacred, and anybody who takes away life shall be punished,\" stated Justice Ogola. After spending six years in remand prison, Cherono had in July this year sought a plea bargain agreement with the prosecution to have her murder charges reduced to manslaughter. She told the court that although she caused Kobilo's death, she did not plan or intend to kill her. The court heard that on a fateful night, at around 8 pm, Cherono had appeared at her neighbour's door, knocked on the door and when the deceased opened it, she attacked her, hitting her with a jembe. Cherono accused Kobilo of befriending her husband and breaking her marriage. The court heard that after hitting the deceased, Cherono pulled her out of the house and dumped her on a nearby farm. Kobilo was later identified by neighbours who rushed her to a nearby dispensary but succumbed to her injuries. A postmortem report from Iten County Hospital tabled in court as an exhibit showed that the deceased died of excessive haemorrhage. After the plea bargain was accepted by the court, Cherono through her lawyer told the court that she was remorseful and that she was a mother of eight children who depended on her. The prosecution submitted that the accused was a first offender with no previous criminal record while recommending up to 10 years imprisonment or two years' probation. The court however ruled out the probation request after the pre-sentence report showed that the victim's family was still bitter with the murder of their kin. \"I have considered the mitigation. The crime which was committed by the accused is heinous. However, although the punishment for manslaughter is life in prison, I have accepted the mitigation by the accused's counsel. The accused is hereby jailed to serve a term of 10 years in prison from the date of arrest,\" ordered Justice Ogola.

         "A man who was on Tuesday found guilty of killing his wife over Sh8,000 has been jailed for 12 years. Albert Odhiambo Odongo killed his wife Eunice Atieno Olal in Homa Bay. Prosecutor Valerie Ongeti told the court that Odongo committed the offence at Kotieno village in Kasipul Constituency on June 7, 2015. Odongo had been accused of killing the wife after disagreeing over the money. He accused the wife of stealing the cash. The court heard that after the disagreement, Odongo left home for an alcohol den. He later returned home with two men with whom he assaulted Eunice and killed her at the scene. One of the witnesses Evaline Akoth testified that Odongo and his group also assaulted her when she tried to defend Eunice. \"The following day, I was informed that Eunice had died,\" Akoth said. Ongeti told the court that Odongo lied to the police that his wife had been killed by unknown criminals. \"A report from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations indicates that Odongo lied to police yet they had killed his wife in the bedroom,\" Ongeti said. The case was later changed from murder to manslaughter after the court established that Odongo did not intend to kill his wife. Four witnesses testified in the case. Odongo denied the charge before High Court judge Joseph Karanja in Homa Bay. The judge said the evidence adduced by the witnesses was adequate to prove that he committed the offence. \"You have been sentenced accordingly but you have 14 days to appeal,\" Karanja said. Odongo pleaded for leniency on grounds that he married another wife after Eunice's death and the woman left him with children after they disagreed. \"I plead for leniency because I am the one who is taking care of my children because their mother disappeared after we disagreed,\" Odongo said. He was taken to Homa Bay Prison. Click here for the latest political news.",

         "A seemingly open-and-shut case where a man confessed to murder took a twist after he recanted his testimony but the court upheld his conviction. POO drove himself to Buruburu police station on the morning of June 9, 2015 and repeatedly told the officer at the desk, \"Nimeua bibi yangu.\" He had used the chord of an iron box to strangle her to death. Calm, composed and oblivious of the implication of the confession, the man asked the officer to come with him to his Phase 5 house to see the body of his wife, AMM, lying in the store, cold, and the iron box chord still on the neck. His narrative in court suggests that he felt justified to strangle his wife of close to five years to death. The man said AMM was his second wife, being a polygamous man. But the wife grew adulterous, bringing disease in the family. Court testimony from witnesses show that AMM had increasingly normalised engaging in sex outside her marriage with multiple men and had even let her husband know. She promised to change but indulged again and again. On June 8, 2015, she had gone to meet her ex-boyfriend at his house in Kahawa Sukari to revive the fading embers of their romantic relationship. The ex-boyfriend was her college sweetheart but she had ditched him for POO, who was then the director of the college. The husband tracked her down and as was often the case, she had one explanation or another. The ex-boyfriend told the court that while they were together, AMM repeatedly received calls from POO outside the house but appeared restless and fearful. He did not know something awful was afoot. Put on his defense, POO testified that he was a hotelier by profession, owned a hospitality college which he co-directed with AMM and that he was married with two families, the first one starting in 1998. POO claimed that before eventually killing his wife, they had three confrontations. \"When he had pain urinating and was tested, he was informed that he had gonorrhoea, which the doctor informed him was sexually transmitted. He confronted the deceased, who admitted that she was in another relationship. \"Prior to this, the deceased had lied to him that she had gone to the salon, but had come home without getting her hair done. \"A few days later, he started feeling discomfort in his urine. The second scenario took place some months later, when he had the same disease diagnosed, and the third was when he started experiencing severe diarrhoea and when they went to the hospital, they both tested positive for HIV.\" The third confrontation is the one that led to the killing, he said. On the fateful day, he came back home from work at 1pm, finding his wife not there. She would not pick his calls and when she eventually did, she claimed she had gone to Eastleigh to buy some clothes. But when he eventually met her, she had no clothes that she bought and \"upon questioning her further, she told him she had gone to meet a friend, apologised and promised not to leave house without telling him\". He said they went back to the house and after dinner, they showered together and went to bed. \"When he asked for his conjugal rights, the deceased became wild and told him that she had been intimate with a young man during the day and that caused them to have an argument. \"He then began packing her clothes, and told her he would take her to her parents,\" the court papers read. At the end of the trial in March 2019, the court convicted him of the murder and sent him to 20 years jail. On appeal, the man changed his story, denying he ever confessed and insisting on his innocence. He suggested that AMM had committed suicide after he told her that he would return her to her parents. The judges, in a June 9, 2023 decision, the Court of Appeal affirmed his conviction and sentence.",

         "A man who killed his wife by throwing a burning stove on her has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. John Mathenge, 31, was convicted by Nanyuki Resident Judge Mary Kasango who noted that the prosecution had proved beyond doubt that the accused murdered his wife after a beer drinking spree. Mathenge had asked the court to hand him a non-custodial sentence saying that he was remorseful, was now a born again Christian and would never touch alcohol in life. \"The court has noted that you are remorseful but the trauma you subjected you son who was only aged three unimaginable trauma. The family of the deceased and the community is still bitter with your action,\" said Justice Kasango before announcing the sentence. Mathenge had been charged with the murder of his wife Mary Wanjiku Kanyi on December 11, 2015 at Likii Estate, Laikipia County. The court heard how on the night of the material day, Mathenge came to the house drunk, started insulting his wife while demanding for food but refused to eat when served and instead went to bed. After two hours of sleep, he woke up and went to the table room where he lit a paraffin cooking stove. When the wife followed him to find what he was up to, Mathenge threw the burning stove at her, causing 63percent burns on her body. Wanjiku died at Nanyuki Teaching and Referral Hospital, 48 days after admission. Mathenge was convicted on January 30 this year but was not sentenced then after the court asked the children's officer to prepare a report on the possible effects the death of the mother could have had on the only child who had witnessed her mother being attacked with a burning stove. \"When asked about the whereabouts of his mother is, he responded that she had gone to heaven while his father had been taken away by police officers,\" part of the report from the children's department. Justice Kasango directed that as Mathenge serves the sentence, the Laikipia Probation Office and the prison authorities subject him to anger management programmes. The court also ruled that the boy who is now aged five be enrolled in a counselling programme to assist him over trauma that has contributed in poor performance in school.",

         "A man who is on the run for allegedly stabbing his girlfriend to death may have planned the crime, according to friends who also suspect he was secretly married to another woman.\n\nCharity Mukami, 24, was allegedly killed by Martin Kunguru in Nairobi’s Nyayo Estate in Embakasi.\n\nHer body was found almost a week later after several attempts to reach her failed.\n\nAccording to her parents, when she left their home in Tassia estate on December 15, they assumed it was just a routine visit to her boyfriend, since she had not carried a change of clothes. This was the last time she was seen alive.\n\nThe Nairobian has now learnt that Kunguru could have plotted to murder Charity, his lover of two years after their affair went south according to her parents and friends.\n\nOne of the witnesses who spoke to The Nairobian on condition of anonymity claims to have overheard the suspect’s close friends in Nyayo Estate saying Kunguru had sworn to one day kill her girlfriend.\n\nThe deceased’s mother, Teresia Njeri, told The Nairobian that, “They were really not in a stable relationship. In fact, he (Kunguru) attacked her in November and came to apologise in our house.” She added that, “Though he kept off the matter following our warning and advice that he ought to get serious with Charity, including introducing his parents to the family as early as January, he was seen around the estate looking for her.”\n\nThe two met two years ago while working for popular beer company along Thika Road, according to Njeri.\n\nBut after falling in love, Kunguru reportedly urged her to quit the job go into business with him.\n\nWhen she left their home on the material day, her mum was not worried. Besides, as the mother recalls, Charity “called to say she was well and that she will be joining the family for supper. But we became worried when her phone went unanswered. After several attempts, her boyfriend’s phone went through and he claimed that he had bid Charity bye earlier.”\n\nCharity’s mother added that, “I remember telling him that he has killed my daughter when he later told me that Charity had left his house earlier that evening.”\n\n\nWith all the calls going unanswered, Njeri got in touch with the suspect’s mother, who promised to call Kunguru and find out if he had done anything to Charity.\n\nWhen Kunguru’s mother visited her son’s three-bedroom house in Nyayo Estate, she claimed not to have heard or seen anyone until the following day.\n\nCharity’s mother recalls that, “On December 22, I received a call from Kunguru’s mother who broke the sad news after the son’s house was broken into by police following the foul smell of a decomposing body that made neighbours suspicious.”\n\nThe body of Charity, who was the second-born in their family, was found in the bedroom covered in blood. There were signs of a struggle in the room.\n\n“Her old mobile phone was on the floor, but it was crushed. Her SIM card was in her new mobile phone and was charging from a bedside socket, proof that it could have been a premeditated murder,” said Njeri.\n\nThe deceased, according to the mother who was among the first to see her body, said her daughter was stabbed six times in the neck and stomach.\n\nPost-mortem results indicated that the fractures on her limbs were inflicted by a blunt object. There were documents in the house indicative that Kunguru could have been married to another woman.\n\nBeatrice Nyambura, Charity’s sister, described her as loving and hard-working.\n\nEfforts to trace Kunguru who is still on the run are yet to bear fruits. His phone has been switched off and his family claims that he has not reached out to them or made contact.\n\n“We want justice for our daughter. We are hopeful that it will be so since police investigating the matter” said a distraught Njeri.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

His lawyer asked for a bond hearing which will be considered during the mention.\n\nCOURT DELAY\n\nMr Charles Kioko, a brother of the deceased, had on Monday contacted Nairobi News to raise concerns on the delay to arraign the suspect in court.\n\nBuruburu DCIO Jeremiah Ikao confirmed to Nairobi News that there was a hitch on Monday morning that had prompted the delay. The suspect was later arraigned  at Makadara law courts but the magistrate said the murder case could only be handled by the high court.\n\nThe deceased is said to have been a gifted athlete who played football in the school’s team and was also a member of the Redeemed Gospel Church Mathare football team.\n\nShe will be buried in Sagana, Machakos county, on February 20, 2016.",

But on January 7 Chelele was found murdered, and her body dumped outside her house in Kapkwen, Bomet county.The state dropped charges against Chemutai while directing that officer Eric Musila remains in custody.

Musila has failed to take a plea twice as a mob attempted to lynch him while he was being escorted to prison.

         "A 21-year-old university student who went missing together with her boyfriend during a hiking expedition in Mt Kenya close to a year ago has been found dead. The decomposed body of Ms Yvonne Mwendwa was found in Mt Kenya Forest by game wardens on Friday, ending an 11-month search.\n\nMs Mwendwa’s mother, Ms Jadrine Kanyua, said they were contacted by authorities and they confirmed that the body was that o her daughter.\n\n“It is true. We were informed and I saw the body,” said Ms Kanyua. The student at Kirinyaga University in Nyeri County disappeared together with her boyfriend, 22-year-old musician Dennis Kirimi, while hiking Mt Kenya on September 30 last year.\n\nKenya Wildlife Service (KWS) Senior Warden Simon Gitau confirmed that only one body was found as the whereabouts of Mr Kirimi remained unknown.\n\n“My officers reported only finding one body and the crime scene investigators from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations were called in for further probe,” said Mr Gitau. “We still do not know about the whereabouts of the man but the matter is being handled by police.”\n\nThe cause of death of the student however remains unknown as Mr Gitau said a further study of the body would reveal more information. Investigations had initially pointed at a suicide pact or a possible abduction but detectives were yet to find conclusive information on what transpired. An extensive search led to the discovery of a suicide note in a hostel in Kerugoya, Kirinyaga County, that the two reportedly shared. The note would become a contentious lead into the investigation of their disappearance with the deceased’s mother disputing that her daughter was the author of the note despite it bearing her name.\n\nMs Mwendwa’s friends also doubted that she wrote the note, saying the handwriting was not hers.\n\nFriends and relatives of the two said the couple had left Kirinyaga to hike Mt Kenya but never returned.\n\nMr Livingstone Kirimi, the father of Mr Kirimi, told the Nation that his son told him he was going to Chuka, in Tharaka-Nithi County, to shoot a video but eventually pass through Kerugoya. “I cannot say more but I’m glad that she has been found. I am at peace now,” said Ms Kanyua at the weekend.\n\nOn the fateful day, a taxi driver they had hired told wardens that they had asked him to wait for them. \n\n  ",

         "Residents of Pesi Village in Laikipia West were Monday morning shocked to find a decomposing body of a woman in a maize plantation. The body of 22-year-old Grace Wamaitha was discovered after a dog came home carrying a human arm. Ms Wamaitha went missing several days ago only for her headless and mutilated body to be found in a neighbouring maize plantation. \"My dog returned home carrying a bone and after keenly inspecting I noticed it was human arm. I called my friends and we followed the path where the dog had come from only to bump on the decomposing body of the woman,\" said Mr Erick Karanu an area resident. \"We raised the alarm that attracted other villagers and police officers from Pesi Police Patrol Base who arrived at the scene,\" he added. The dead woman's head was also discovered a few metres from the scene. SUSPECT ARRESTED Police officers rescued a man who had been living with the woman from the irate residents who baying for his blood, accusing him of killing the woman. It was reported that the suspect, a farmhand, had eloped with the woman, forcing her out of her former marriage and has since July been cohabiting with her. Another man, Mr John Njama, who was earlier married to the deceased woman said that they separated after he discovered that she was having an affair with another man. \"We separated with her after noticing that she was having an extra-marital affair with the man. She at some point attempted to set my house ablaze after warning her over the issue,\" said Mr Njama. EMBRACE NYUMBA KUMI Nyahururu OCPD Ezekiel Chepkwony said they are holding the suspect as they continue with investigations. The police boss said that preliminary investigations revealed that the woman could have been killed inside their house before her body was dump in the maize farm. \"The bloody clothes and signs of commotion inside their house is evidence that the woman could have been killed inside the house. We have launched investigations to establish when the incident occurred,\" he said. Mr Chepkwony challenged members of the public to embrace the Nyumba Kumi initiative to ensure that they are able to identify the families living around them in order to deal with conflicts before matters go out of hand.",

According to sources, Roho Fweny Church priest Elisha Ogolla, 57, had been in an illicit affair for a while with Linnet Onyango, 40, a mother of six. Local Chief Ambrose Ogema said a woman who had gone to seek spiritual counsel from the pastor sounded an alarm after she saw blood flowing from his house. \"The deceased had gone to the priest's rented house at around 2pm. It seems they (lovers) had a quarrel before the priest brutally murdered the woman and mutilated her genitals,\" said Mr Ogema. Neighbours broke into the house and found the pastor gasping for air in the sitting room and Onyango's mutilated body lying on the floor. The priest died at Usenge beach while being taken to Usenge Police Station.

We suspect he might have taken poison after killing the woman,\" said the chief. He further added that the priest might have drugged the woman before killing her since the neighbours did not hear any commotion from the house. The administrator said that the duo had an illicit affair and the church was in the process of discussing their illicit affairs and possibly discipline the errant priest. Mr Ogema added that he had earlier received complaints from the woman's husband who claimed that the priest was having an affair with his wife thus breaking their marriage. \"The relationship between the two was well known in the village and it had raised a lot of eyebrows to the extent of the woman and her husband being in a tense relationship,\" said Mr Ogema. Bondo OCPD Paul Kiarie confirmed the incident stating that the bodies have been moved to the Bondo sub-county hospital for postmortem. ALSO READ: Man who exposed police killings in Nakuru executed Mr Kiarie added that they have launched probe on the matter as a way of determining the priest's actions.

The leaders who included three members of the Taita-Taveta County Assembly asked the police to thoroughly investigate the killing of Diana Mkandoe Maganga, 70 claiming similar bizarre incidents had occurred in the area. Speaking to The Standard in Wundanyi town yesterday, the MCAs among them Raymond Mwangola (Wundanyi-Mbale Ward), and two Nominated County Representatives Ruth Ilao and Rachael Dawai claimed the deceased private parts were removed by her killers. They at the same time claimed that a postmortem examination conducted at Wesu Sub County Hospital found out that the deceased eyes were also gorged out. \"The postmortem examination conducted in our presence revealed that the deceased private parts were removed and eyes gorged out at that is why we are linking the incident to ritual killing,\" claimed Ms Ilao, a relative to the deceased. Mr Mwangola claimed there were several other similar incidents that had occurred in the area. \"Two months ago, a similar incident occurred at Mgange-Nyika where a youth was killed in mysterious circumstances,\" said the ODM legislator.

Dawai blamed the increased rape incidences to cultural decay among the local community. Ms Maganga's decomposing naked body was dumped in a forest in the county. Police and relatives said the undressed body was found at Iyale forest near Lushangondyi Primary School in Taita Sub County. Her tattered clothes were found scattered at the scene where the body was discovered. Her killers could have robbed her of unknown amount of money, mobile phone among other valuables, said the police and relatives. According to the police and relatives the deceased went missing last Friday and her decomposing body found by villagers on Tuesday evening. The deceased hailed from Shagha village in Wumingu location, Taita Sub County. \"The incident is brutal and barbaric. I have never seen such a thing happening in the area,\" said the deceased last born son Nicholas Mwakio at the Wundanyi Police Station where the family recorded a statement. Mr Mwakio who is a tour consultant in Mombasa said his brother in-law and sister offered her mother a boda boda to take her to her destination but declined. \"After she declined to board a boda boda I gave her Sh 1,500 for use at home,\" said the deceased son in-law Rophus Mwakanyi. He said the deceased had visited them at Murugua village in Bura location, Mwatate Sub County last week. \"The deceased had visited us following the death of one of our relatives and on Friday she left for her matrimonial home where she did not reach,\" he said. \"We told her to board a boda boda but she declined. She wanted to go on foot to Wesu Sub County Hospital to see a patient before going back home where she did not reach,\" maintained Mr Mwakanyi who is also a primary school teacher in the area. Speaking to The Standard in Wundanyi town on Wednesday, Mr Mwakio said they had reported the deceased disappearance to the police after she did not reach home where a search for her started. \"We dispatched a search party from Bura and Wumingu locations to look for her since Saturday in vain,\" she said. Mwakio said on Tuesday, a woman who went to answer a call of nature in the forest found the naked decomposing body and alerted police and villagers. \"We went to the scene and identified the body of our mother. Police later removed and took the body to the hospital mortuary,\" he said. Mwakio said police recovered two abandoned underpants believed to be of her mother's killers. \"My mother was in good health when she left home last week to visit his son in law's family. We believe she was raped and murdered. Police should conduct thorough investigations into the cause of death,\" he said. Taita OCPD Benjamin Muhia confirmed and said investigations into the incident had been launched. \"We suspect the deceased was first raped before she was murdered. Postmortem examination will however determine the actual cause of death,\" the police officer told The Standard on the phone.",

         "The body of a 12-year-old girl who went missing on Saturday evening was found dumped near a river in Getare, Kisii town. The family of the orphaned girl, Cynthia Mayaka, had searched for the Standard Six girl for the better part of Saturday night only for them to find her body yesterday morning. Residents suspected that the girl might have been defiled before being murdered. The body lay in a pool of blood. The girl had been living with her grandmother following the death of her parents years ago. The grandmother had sent her to buy milk from a neighbour but she failed to return home. The family said the victim left home around 4pm on Saturday with a two-litre can to buy milk but they grew worried when she failed to return by 7pm. The body was found by an elderly man cutting napier grass on his farm on Sunday morning. ALSO READ: Saving women from domestic violence Kisii nominated MCA and anti-gender-based violence activist Risper Kemunto said rape and other forms of gender-based violence were on the rise in the area. \"Opinion leaders and politicians are quiet when it comes to violence in the home,\" she said. Kisii County Police Commander Agnes Mudamba said her officers had initiated investigations into the killing. \"Our officers will remain vigilant and ensure that everybody involved in the crime is apprehended,\" she said. Sources who sought anonymity said the girl had told one of her aunts that two young men had been following her whenever she went to a nearby spring to fetch water.",

         "A middle aged man has been sentenced to 20 year imprisonment for killing his pregnant wife. Geoffrey Olero was found guilty of murdering his wife identified as Linda Olero at their Koluoch Village home, Kadumo East Location in Rachuonyo East Sub County on January 18, 2017. ALSO READ:\n \n High profile murders come back to haunt Muhoro The Judgment was read by Justice Joseph Karanja on behalf of his colleague Hellen Omondi. Ms Omondi concluded that the matter was manslaughter rather than murder. \"I am convinced that the accused thought this was a way of disciplining the lady but it resulted to death. In my opinion this qualifies to be manslaughter,\" said Justice Omondi. All the five prosecution witnesses who testified in the case implicated Olero. Joshua Okoth who had inherited the Olero's mother said the accused told him that he was fighting with the wife when she got injured. Avoid fake news!

When I opened the kitchen door, I found wife lying dead on the floor,\" said Okoth. Felix Ongae, the Olero's maternal uncle had told the court that the accused sought protection at his home after disagreeing with his wife. He added that the lady had failed to get up after he had slapped her. Doctor Peter Ogola who conducted postmortem at Rachuonyo South Sub County Hospital, said Olero's wife death was caused by injuries she had sustained. Ogola indicated that she suffered injuries which caused separation of the placenta from the uterus in her womb. The heinous act occurred when Linda had a seven moth pregnancy.

There was also bruising from the brain besides injury on the trunk,\" the Doctor's report indicated. But Olero denied committing the offense saying his wife died in his absence. \"I was not at home on the day my wife died since gone to work and never returned. When I returned home, the following day, police came and arrested me claiming that I had killed someone,\" he said. But this was objected by Prosecutor Valery Ongeti who argued that the evidence given by other witness could convince an ordinary person that the accused killed his wife. The accused has 14 days to appeal.",

         "On August 12, 2005 at around 7pm, Joyce Gacheri and her grandson Amos Murega were in her home in Gaintume Village, Meru County preparing dinner.A few minutes later, Gacheri's daughter-in-law Dorcas Kaguri arrived from Meru town with luggage. She left the items with her son Murega saying she was going to buy paraffin from the local shopping centre. However, when Kaguri came back, about 30 minutes later, she was visibly drunk and was staggering around the compound.Kaguri's husband Julius Koome, who had been working on the farm all day, was preparing dinner for his children when his drunk wife arrived home from town. He was not amused by his wife's state and a quarrel ensured between the couple, which quickly degenerated into a physical fight. Gacheri and Murega's efforts to calm the two was futile and when Koome stuck his wife, Gacheri tried to pull them apart and requested them not to fight at her home.The irate Koome then grabbed a metallic pipe and hammer like object which he used to strike Kaguri who fell to the ground. He then started kicking her even though she did not fight back at this point.Gacheri and Murega sought refuge and assistance from a neighbour Patrick Kibuu who told them to inform the village elder, which they did.Murega returned home at around 9pm and did not find his mother at the home. The following day, Kaguri was found dead at Gacheri's doorstep and Koome was immediately arrested and arraigned in court for the murder of his wife.He denied the charges saying while he confronted his wife, he only threatened to beat her up and she fled before he did.The trial court, however, found Koome guilty of murder and sentenced him to death.He appealed the decision but on June 24, 2016, Nyeri Court of Appeal judges Phillip Waki, Roselyn Nambuye and Patrick Kiage dismissed his appeal.The judges noted that Koome was the last person to see Kaguri alive and he could not account for his whereabouts between 7pm and 9pm.",

Accused to be sentenced on November 6, says judge The High Court has convicted a 34-year-old man after finding him guilty of raping and murdering his grandmother. Wilson Masiko Mungasia killed Selina Ikambi Anasi,79, on February 10, 2011, at their Mituri village home in Kakamega East. Ikambi, a herbalist, was reported missing on February 9. She lived in the same compound with the accused. Family members said Masiko could not state where the victim was and did not participate in the search. Your opinion is valuable. Take this quick survey to help us improve the website and content Julietta Musee told court he was the last person seen entering Ikambi's house before she went missing. The court heard that family members later stumbled on Ikambi's body in a sugarcane plantation. It had been wrapped in a blanket. Her killer had stuffed her mouth with pieces of blanket. A used male condom still embedded in her genitals. ALSO READ:\n \n Kakamega man convicted for murdering grandmother Government pathologist Dixon Mchana told court the victim had a deep cut on her forehead. Dr Mchana concluded the cause of death was head injury. He also said there was evidence of sexual assault. Justice Ruth Sitati said the prosecution had proved the case of murder against Masiko beyond any reasonable doubt. Justice Sitati noted Masiko fled after his grandmother's body was recovered, only to re-appear for her burial, five days later. Alhough the prosecution relied on consequential evidence, since there was no eye-witness, the judge said the evidence was sufficient to place the accused at the centre of the felony. \"The accused is the one who lived with the deceased and when she disappeared, he was seen coming out of her house. When he was asked about her whereabouts, he spoke with a certain degree of certainty, that she had gone to treat some children,\" Justice Sitati said in her judgement read by Justice William Musyoka. She added: \"In my view, he had a duty and in his own interest, to explain how she died. Having failed to do so, the only inference this court can make is that he knew she had died.\" ALSO READ:\n \n Isiolo Imam accused of raping 16-year-old schoolgirl \"From the analysis, I find that the accused is guilty of murder and convict him accordingly,\" the judge said.

         "Former journalist Moses Dola Otieno yesterday claimed that his wife Wambui Kabiru died after hitting her head on a bed. Dola yesterday told the court that a quarrel over music volume left his wife and former NTV reporter dead. In an emotional blow-by-blow account, the former Nation journalist narrated the events of May 1, 2011. Dola explained, that on the material day, he woke up at 7.30am, headed to the sitting room and started playing some gospel music which beamed in all rooms. He then went back to the bedroom where Wambui was sleeping and she allegedly questioned why he put loud music while she and their son were asleep. \"That was where the problem began. Wambui had a problem with the music and she said in Kiswahili 'Wewe ukiamka kwa hii nyumba kwani kila mtu lazima aamke (If you wake up in this house, is it a must that every one else wakes up?),\" Dola narrated. ALSO READ: Boy, 12, found guilty of murdering 'girlfriend' in Nakuru He said Wambui then went to the sitting room, unplugged the music system and came back to the bed room. \"I felt a little bit irritated. I went back and restarted the music and reduced the volume further,\" he said. According to Dola, Wambui was using a metallic pair of scissors to trim the edges of her dreadlocks when he returned to the bedroom. The two quarreled, and Dola decided to take their son, who had just woken up, away. Dola testified that Wambui then went after him with the pair of scissors. \"Just as I was picking our son, she shot up and charged at me. She asked where I wanted to take her baby. In her charging she was holding that metallic scissors. It was a split second event. Unfortunately it pricked my hand but I managed to squeeze her hand and she released it,\" Dola testified while showing his palm to show where he got stabbed. The judge was told that Wambui reached for the scissors but Dola tackled her, and they both fell on the bed. ALSO READ: Murder of aspirants children blamed on family feud He testified: \"She hit her head on the bed, but because we fell on the mattress I did not realise that she was injured.\" According to Dola, his wife's last words were \"ona umeniumiza\" (see you have hurt me). He then took their son for breakfast and left her in bed. According to Dola, he went to his brother in law's house in a bid to seek a truce with his wife. After that both Wambui's brother and Dola went to drink. He testified that he was to take his bother in law to a baby shower later in the evening and thus they parted ways and he headed back to the house to freshen up. When he got to the house, the court heard, Wambui was still lying in bed and did not respond when he called her name. ALSO READ: Murder of aspirants children blamed on family feud",

         "Musa Wekesa A pastor from Kitale has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for defiling and later killing a high school student who was pregnant with triplets in 2011. While passing the judgement, Justice Hillary Chemitei said evidence presented before the court established that pastor Charles Nyachwara, who served at Yuya Pentecostal Assemblies of God, was guilty of killing the minor with an intention of maintaining his status in the community. \"I have heard litigation by both the Prosecution and Defence sides. What is evident is that the minor suffered a cruel death in your hands. You have a right of appeal,\" said Justice Chemitei while delivering the judgment. Pastor Nyachwara is said to have stabbed Scholastica Mmbihi to death using a kitchen knife on July 7, 2011 in a bid to end a court tussle between him and the girl's family after he defiled and impregnated her. The family of the Yuya Secondary School student had launched criminal proceedings against the pastor after he impregnated their daughter. Nyachwara confessed to killing the girl to protect his priestly image after his efforts to settle the matter with the family out of court was unfruitful. \"I wish to state that I killed her because his father was not prepared to withdraw a defilement charge against me at Kitale law courts,\" said the pastor. Postmortem reports submitted in the court earlier revealed that the deceased was pregnant with triplets. The girl's father, Paul Mmbihi, who has waited for long for justice said he will not appeal the judgment.",

         "A father who killed his wife nine years ago after he found her having sex with another man in the bush will continue serving his 20-year sentence. The appellate court threw out his appeal. Mdoe Kombe was sentenced and convicted in 2018 on the lesser offence of manslaughter after the High Court found that he indeed killed his wife Kwekwe Nyanje. Kombe had been charged with murdering Kwekwe on October 4, 2011, at about 4pm in Majugwani village, Mwereni location, Kwale county. Kombe had admitted to having killed his wife. However, he stated that it was because he had found her having sex with another man in a bush. He allegedly chased the man and his wife escaped to her parents' home, where he had found her and eventually stabbed her to death. The trial court in its judgment ruled that the husband was provoked into committing the offence. It convicted him of manslaughter rather than the murder he had been charged with, going ahead to sentence him to 20 years behind bars. He appealed, arguing that the judge erred in law by failing to see that nobody testified to have witnessed seeing him at the alleged scene of crime killing his wife, which he later withdrew and stuck to appealing the sentence. He challenged the sentence, arguing that counsel asserted that the sentence was harsh and excessive. Counsel also said after he was convicted, the appellant had stated in mitigation that he was a first offender, was now a single parent, and had shown remorse, and prayed for leniency. However, Justices DK Musinga, Gatembu Kairu and Agnes Murgor dismissed his arguments on sentence, ruling they had no jurisdiction to entertain appeals on the severity of the sentence. \"Bearing this in mind, we are of the view that the learned judge took into account the facts of the case, and more particularly the appellant's probation report, and exercising of his discretion, sentenced the appellant to 20 years' imprisonment,\" the court ruled. \"As such, we have no reason to interfere with the sentence imposed.\" During the trial of the case at the High Court, Kombe's father-in-law had testified that his late daughter and Kombe had an understanding that she went back home. Kombe allegedly followed her to their home to resolve the misunderstanding, but when his father-in-law went to call the elders to settle the dispute, he was called by his wife and told that his daughter had been stabbed. \"On his return, he found that the appellant had left the home and his daughter was lying in a pool of blood with a huge cut wound on her neck,\" court papers read.",

         "A court has recommended that former TV news anchor Louis Otieno be subjected to fresh tests to establish whether he was involved in the murder of Careen Chepchumba, his girlfriend who was murdered six years ago. Ms Careen was found dead inside her apartment at Santonia Court, Kilimani, on February 12, 2012, and after investigations police said they did not have a suspect. PUBLIC INQUEST Accusing police of bungling the investigations and recommending a public inquest, former Kibera Resident magistrate Charles Ondiek urged the Director of Public Prosecutions to direct fresh probe to resolve the murder of Careen. Mr Otieno denied killing Ms Careen or ever having a romantic affair with her. He however admitted that she was his friend. \"The cause of Careen's death was not suicide, it was not accidental. The cause of death of Careen Chepchumba Kili can not be said to be undetermined. The cause was strangulation. These are inevitable findings,\" the court stated. The court found that police exonerated Mr Otieno of involvement in the murder even before carrying forensic analysis of his phones and of the deceased to establish where he was at the time Careen was murdered. \"Having found no eye witness, forensic evidence was the sure key to unlock criminal culpability by some known person or persons. In fact, this investigation was hinged and turned on a composite of two key evidence namely forensic and circumstantial,\" the inquest found. It follows that in the absence of forensic evidence and having not considered the circumstantial evidence, the far-reaching conclusion by the team of investigators that there was no evidence to support a theory of murder was hollow, devoid of merit and thus clearly unfounded, the court observed. It has recommended that samples of Mr Otieno's finger nails be taken in the presence of Head of Government Chemist who shall take them immediately after documentation by police. The inquest was told how nail clippings taken by police from Otieno turned out to be of Careen during analysis by experts at the Government Chemist. The court directed that the mix up of the clippings be investigated too. The vehicle was repossessed by the dealer and later sold to recover the debt.",

         "In late 2009, James Mulu Mulewa, then aged 21, met 19-year-old Mercy Muthethya Ngali in Mathare North, Nairobi. James was dazzled by Mercy's skin, smile and hair, and decided to ask for friendship from the thing of beauty. Mercy obliged and since they both worked in the city centre, they started meeting over coffee and hanging out on weekends. Soon, the strong wave love swept them off their feet and for two and a half years, they referred to each other \"my love\". By the start of 2012, their bond had grown so strong that James, then 23, wanted to take the relationship to the next level. But deep down his heart, all was not all. SEXUAL DESIRE While they were closer than close, he was frustrated that the girl he loved and gave his all had refused to get intimate with him. He had employed all the tricks in the dating book to no avail and this made him very angry. Unable to think with his head, his sexual desire drove him down the road of ruin. On Monday, February 27, 2012, James and Mercy rose and rushed to work in CBD as usual. In the evening, the two love birds boarded the same matatu to Mathare North and on alighting, James insisted on accompanying his love to her home. She caved in to his pressure and they both walked to her mother's house. There was no one home and upon entering the house, James saw an opportunity: He demanded for sex. Like she had done over and over again, Mercy said no. But James could hear none of it. ATTACK He grabbed her, pushed her into her mother's bed and attempted to rape her, the High Court in Nairobi ruled on Friday after finding him guilty of murdering the young woman who was full of life. According to state prosecutor Charles Okeyo, James tore his fiancee's underpants as he forced her to have sex. When he failed to satisfy his desire, the prosecutor said, James became wild and in a fit of fury he pulled a knife from his pocket and stabbed her 16 times. Overpowered and defenceless, Mercy screamed attracting the attention of neighbours. James refused to open the door, compelling the alarmed neighbours to call police officers who were on patrol. On arrival, police ordered him to open the door or else they force their way in. With trembling hands and quaking in his shoes, the man who had done the unthinkable opened the door. On the bed, the lifeless body of Mercy lay in a pool of blood, and on the floor, was the murder weapon-- knife. \"Mulu (James) viciously attacked the defenceless woman whom he had laid in her mother's bed,\" Justice Roselyn Korir said in her conviction. \"Mulu assaulted his would-be wife by stabbing her six times in her private parts, six times in her lower abdomen, one time in her liver twice in her thighs and once in her buttocks.\" She said the murder could only have been committed by the accused since he was the only person who was with Mercy moments before her death. The judge said the accused committed a heinous act of pouring anger on an innocent girl who lost her precious life at a tender age. Having secured a successful conviction, Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has only one request to the court: hand down the mandatory death sentence to this man. Mr Okeyo, the state prosecutor representing Mr Haji, on Friday urged Justice Korir \"to have no mercy\" on James who killed Mercy without provocation. He said James' date with the hangman would serve as a warning to men who have no respect for women and human life. But in his mitigation, a subdued James pleaded for leniency, saying he has reformed and has even pursued theological studies while in remand prison. The judge will visit the scene of the murder before passing her sentence on December 5. Harry Misiko contributed to this report.",

         "A former city pastor convicted of killing his alleged mistress eight years ago has lost his appeal. Pastor Paul Ng'ang'a of Well of Faith Ministries in Gatina Kawangware was found guilty of the 2012 murder of Carolyne Chanjirah. Ng'ang'a was charged alongside keyboard player James Muia, who was later acquitted after his testimony helped the court to convict the cleric. Court of Appeal judges Mohammed Warsame, Kathurima M'inoti and Sankale Ole Kantai ruled that the appeal had no merit. The court ruled that the High Court was right to convict Ng'ang'a for the murder based on the evidence presented. \"...we do not see any gaps in the prosecution case that would have undermined the appellant's conviction, nor do we find any bias on the part of the learned judge,\" the court ruled. Court documents showed Ng'ang'a assaulted Chanjirah inside his car at around 8pm on the night of the incident. At Lenana area, Chanjirah flagged down a KK Security vehicle and the guards rescued her. She showed them the pastor's vehicle, which was parked close by. She died later from her injuries. Muia testified that he was with the pastor in the car with the woman. She kept asking how the pastor could neglect his child, he said. The Appeal Court ruled that the conduct of the pastor and the nature of the injuries inflicted on Chanjirah indicated that he intended to kill or inflict grievous injuries on her. \"The deceased succumbed to her injuries within a few hours of the assault and we are therefore satisfied that the prosecution proved malice aforethought on the part of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt,\" the court noted. The judges said the attempt to strangle Chanjirah, the severe blunt force injuries on the head and which killed her all demonstrate the cleric's intent. \"If motive can be drawn from facts, then the evidence of Muia that the deceased was querying what kind of man the appellant was for failing to support his own child, could readily have supplied the motive,\" the court ruled. They ruled that Ng'ang'a fleeing from the scene after excusing himself to go and lock his car was not consistent with his innocence. The pastor claimed in mitigation that he was carjacked at the Junction Mall while in the company of Muia. He said Chanjirah was part of the gang that attacked him and she had blood when she entered his car. However, the judges questioned the heavy staining of his clothes with her blood, the presence of her blood on many parts of the car, including as far as the inside rear roof and on the murder weapon recovered at the scene.",

         "A former banker, who was found guilty of killing his girlfriend, was on Wednesday sentenced to 25 years in prison the High Court in Kitale. The court heard that Samson Kamau Njoroge murdered Alice Wangui Kamau and dumped her body in a borehole in his compound in May 2012 in Naisambu to evade her demands for child support. On the fateful night, Mr Kamau had attended a court case where the deceased wanted him to be compelled to take care of a son born in 2008 as a result of their secret relationship. The deceased went missing and sent distress calls to her family indicating that she had been kidnapped and was being raped repeatedly prompting a search by police. HEINOUS CRIME \"She sent me a text on my phone saying she had been kidnapped and was being raped by the kidnapper,\" Wangui's aunt Eunice Wairimu told the court. Mr Kamau's maid Veronica Njeri told the court that her employer did not spend the night at home on the fateful day. He arrived arrive early in the morning and sent her to the shop. \"When I came back I found him washing clothes which I never saw him do during my two-year stay at the homestead. He later washed his car and left for work without his vehicle as was his norm,\" said Ms Njeri. DENIAL In his defence, Mr Kamau denied involvement in the murder saying the reason he did not spend the night at his homestead on the fateful night was because he was very drunk and could not drive. \"I went home in the morning and decided to wash my clothes since they were very muddy. My maid informed me that police officers were looking for me when I left for work,\" said Mr Kamau. In his judgement, Justice Hillary Chemitei said circumstantial evidence tabled before court had linked Mr Kamau to the heinous act since Ms Wangui's body was retrieved in his compound. \"The police report indicated that the accused's vehicle had blood stains. Who could gain courage to dump the body in his compound's borehole without being noticed?\" stated the judgment.",

         "A court in Machakos on Wednesday acquitted a man accused of killing his ex-wife outside a disco in Mwala. Justice David Kemei said the evidence presented in court was based on suspicion and not sufficient to prove the accused committed the offence. \"The evidence taken as a whole clearly shows the accused was the ex-husband of the deceased and that they were not on good terms,\" the judge said. KMM as identified in court was accused of killing his ex-wife who worked as a barmaid at Up London bar in Mwala, Machakos county, on Christmas day of 2012. He denied the charges asserting that he had not seen his ex-wife on the said date as he spent the day with a friend in his house. Peter Musau told court that the deceased had been his barmaid and that the accused had been his neighbour. He testified that the accused used to frequent the bar to harass the deceased and often issued threats against her after they had separated and that he used to assign one of his workers to be escorting her to her room to avert any possible incidents. \"On the material day, the deceased informed him that the accused had come into the bar and taken drinks without paying. She later that night told me that KMM was pestering her to accompany him to a disco,\" Musau said. He confirmed that the accused had married the deceased and they had two children but that the marriage was rocked with squabbles. \"One time I had accompanied EKN to a police station to lodge report of assault on her by the accused,\" he testified. Peter Muthuku,who worked as a night guard at Mwala market testified that on December 25, 2012, he heard some noise near a disco. He joined his workmate and approached a nearby tree where they found EKN lying on the ground with a stab wound on her neck. Winfred Ndinda testified that on the material day while on patrol, she was alerted by noise at Mwala market and rushed there to find a woman lying under a tree with a kitchen knife stuck in her neck. Elishper Mwikali of Ngelani police post told the court that on the same date at 4.30am, she was at the post when the accused turned up and introduced himself and reported that he had had a disagreement with somebody whom he had stabbed in the neck. The confession was disregarded in court as the police failed to take down a confession statement according to the law. Doctor Fredrick Okinyi said the postmortem examination showed the body had multiple stab wounds in the neck and left chest wall. \"I concluded that the cause of death was hemorrhagic shock due to stab wound to the heart and lungs,\" he said. The accused, in his defence told the court, he was at home with one Joshua Wambua who used to work at a hotel in Mwala market. \"I had presented myself to the station after hearing the news and accusations but I was arrested and forced to confess to killing EKN. KMM said he was placed in the same vehicle as the deceased where he was assaulted causing him to fall on the body of the deceased thus explaining the bloodstains on his t-shirt. \"I loved her and could not kill her. She would visit me at my place every often,\" he said. In his ruling, Justice Kemei said although the accused is stated to have confessed to have committed the offence, there is no independent evidence that points towards his participation. \"The mere fact that the two knew each other and had frequent disagreements does not amount to proof of culpability. I therefore acquit the accused,\" he ruled.",

But that also never happened after the court consigned her to jail. \n \n On June 30, 2013, Susan had attended Sunday service alongside her two sisters at Full Gospel Church in Mai Mahiu, only for her not to return home or to be seen alive again. \n \n if (shouldRenderAd(false)) {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function () {\n \n googletag.display(\"desktop-article-ad-1\");\n \n });\n \n // Initial load (before ad refresh)\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 5000);\n \n setInterval(function refreshAds() {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {\n \n googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-1']]);\n \n });\n \n // During ad refresh\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.classList.remove('center-align-ad');\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 2000);\n \n }, 90000);\n \n }\n \n Her disfigured body was found the following day in an open field with stab wounds on the head and in the neck region. \n \n The torso (upper part of the body) appeared to have been extensively scalded, either by being burnt or by corrosive substances. \n \n Crime of passion \n \n The body was half naked, with only some fragments of her clothing on the body. \n \n \"The murder was a crime of passion. The accused pretended to be uninvolved and put forth a defence that was found to be flimsy and fictitious,\" trial judge Richard Mwongo said. \n \n \"It was a cruel and cleverly schemed murder,\" added the judge. \n \n At the time of her death, Susan was on vacation and employed at a firm owned by Mr Peter Chege Kabura, who was a friend of one Simon Kibarabara - Waruguru's husband and the alleged lover of the deceased. \n \n Susan allegedly worked as a broker in the real estate field before going to university. \n \n Mr Kibarabara was himself in the real estate business while his wife Waruguru used to operate a shop and MPESA business in Maai Mahiu town. \n \n Susan's family and that of Waruguru lived in King'ori estate and were friends. In fact, Waruguru and Susan related well and were close friends. \n \n if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function () {\n \n googletag.display(\"mobile-article-ad-2\");\n \n });\n \n // Initial load (before ad refresh)\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 5000);\n \n setInterval(function refreshAds() {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {\n \n googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-2']]);\n \n });\n \n // During ad refresh\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.classList.remove('center-align-ad');\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 2000);\n \n }, 90000);\n \n }\n \n On June 30, 2013, Susan accompanied her sisters to Full Gospel Church, Mai Mahiu. After church, the sisters were joined by the househelp, Ms Njeri Ndungu, and all proceeded to a restaurant known as GMT Guest House for lunch. \n \n Once at the hotel, their order took too long and Susan was growing impatient. \n \n Death trap \n \n She requested to be served what was ready. After the meal, she left the party at about 4pm, saying she had been called by Waruguru to view some boutique merchandise. \n \n  The said beauty items, which included a beaded purse, were at Waruguru's home. \n \n As she was rushing to Waruguru's home to view the beauty products, little did Susan know that she was being lured to a death trap. \n \n \"The evidence pointed to her having cunningly lured the deceased to her death. The motive attributed to the planned murder was that the deceased was engaged in a romantic affair with the accused's husband, Simon Kibarabara,\" said Justice Mwongo. \n \n Before she left, Susan and her sisters agreed they would let her know once they got back home, as she was travelling to Nairobi later that day. \n \n Several phone calls to her number, however, went unanswered. Eventually, the phone stopped ringing. \n \n One of the sisters, Ms Mary Nyambura, then rang Waruguru to inquire on Susan's whereabouts. However, Waruguru denied asking Susan over to her home. \n \n However, after the body was found, she admitted communicating with the deceased. \n \n Ms Nyambura said after the body was collected by police officers, Waruguru, just like other neighbours, visited the bereaved family. \n \n Ms Nyambura, however, questioned her on her last moments with the deceased. \n \n \"When I questioned her, she said when she got the call from Susan, she had promised to call her back 15 minutes later, as she was in a noisy place. She further said she had not called her back. She showed me her phone... and excused herself to go attend to her baby,\" said Ms Nyambura. \n \n Mobile phone data collected by police investigators showed that Susan related very closely with Waruguru's husband. This was evidenced by multiple telephone calls and text messages between them. \n \n if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function () {\n \n googletag.display(\"mobile-article-ad-3\");\n \n });\n \n // Initial load (before ad refresh)\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 5000);\n \n setInterval(function refreshAds() {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {\n \n googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['mobile-article-ad-3']]);\n \n });\n \n // During ad refresh\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.classList.remove('center-align-ad');\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 2000);\n \n }, 90000);\n \n }\n \n The prosecution used the phone data to prove that Waruguru, a mother of four, had a motive to murder the young woman. \n \n Call data evidence showed that Susan and Waruguru converged at the time of her death. Immediately after the cruel murder, Waruguru ceased all contact with Susan's telephone. \n \n An examination of the call log data, for instance, showed Waruguru's husband had on June 20, 2013, made five calls and sent messages to Susan between 7.30am and 7.46pm. \n \n The data further indicated that, on the same day, Waruguru's husband had seven calls with his wife (Waruguru), most of which were initiated by her. \n \n However, most of the calls between Susan and Kibarabara were initiated by the latter and lasted long. One call between the two lasted more than 800 seconds, as compared to those he had Waruguru, which were brief. The longest with Waruguru on that day lasted only 23 seconds. \n \n if (shouldRenderAd(false)) {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function () {\n \n googletag.display(\"desktop-article-ad-2\");\n \n });\n \n // Initial load (before ad refresh)\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 5000);\n \n setInterval(function refreshAds() {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function adCommands() {\n \n googletag.pubads().refresh([window.adSlots['desktop-article-ad-2']]);\n \n });\n \n // During ad refresh\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.classList.remove('center-align-ad');\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 2000);\n \n }, 90000);\n \n }\n \n The phone data further showed that on June 22, eight calls were exchanged between Waruguru and her husband from 10.33am to 9.44pm, the longest lasting 112 seconds. \n \n On the other hand, the first call between Susan and Waruguru's husband was at 9.33am, followed by a further 10 calls, the last at 6.52pm and the longest taking 161 seconds. \n \n According to the evidence, Waruguru's husband and Susan appeared to have been together in Kiambu from the evening of June 22 to the early afternoon of June 23, 2013. \n \n That could have explained why, unlike in the previous days, only two calls were exchanged between Mr Kibarabara and Susan. \n \n \"Business associate or not, the accussed's husband was a married man; what business was so pressing that he allowed long and intermittent phone communication with a single young lady at odd hours in the morning, night and all day, while communicating by phone rather briefly, if at all, with his wife?\" posed justice Mwongo. \n \n The call data further shows June 29 was also an active day for Susan and Waruguru's husband. \n \n Exhibits adduced in court reflected 19 calls between Susan and Kibarabara, the first and longest one at 8:54am (lasting 1,296 seconds) and throughout the day until 8:24pm (the latter lasting 96 seconds). \n \n if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function () {\n \n googletag.display(\"mobile-article-ad-4\");\n \n });\n \n // Initial load (before ad refresh)\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 5000);\n \n }\n \n In contrast, only two calls were made between the accused and her husband on that date, the longest lasting 20 seconds. \n \n \"And although the deceased's sisters confirm that the accused and the deceased had a friendship, it is interesting that the call logs between June 20 and June 30, 2013 record three SMSs and one call on June 25, one call on June 28, two calls and an SMS on June 29 and on June 30 four SMSs exchanged between 3.25pm and 4.15pm,\" said Justice Mwongo. \n \n Waruguru wanted a non-custodial sentence, but Justice Mwongo said that would have passed the wrong message to many thousands of women and men stuck up in situations where their spouses are in romantic affairs with girlfriends and boyfriends, commonly called \"mpango wa kando\". \n \n \"A non-custodial sentence may even trigger the idea that murder is fashionable and rewarding - that it is an appropriate cure for mpango wa kando. The answer to this time-immemorial malady cannot be murder,\" said Justice Mwongo. \n \n He added: \"The answer lies not in the liquidation of the third party but in the management of the deviant spouse. That is the message that ought to be communicated.\" \n \n During the entire murder trial and even after been found guilty, Waruguru maintained her innocence. \n \n After her sentencing, her two lawyers told the court Waruguru was \"sorrowful\" and \"very remorseful for the offence\". \n \n Justice Mwongo noted the Probation Officer's report, however, stated as follows on the attitude of the offender to the offence: \"The offender says she did not commit the offence.\" \n \n \"Here, I sense contradiction and insincerity, rather than remorse,\" said the judge. The probation officer had recommended a non-custodial sentence, pointing out that if granted, the accused would need comprehensive rehabilitation including mental health care through a psychiatrist to deter recidivism to such violent crime. \n \n In her defence under oath, Waruguru said on the fateful Sunday, she had gone to church and in the evening she attended a pre-wedding meeting at PCEA Church Maai Mahiu. \n \n if (shouldRenderAd(true)) {\n \n googletag.cmd.push(function () {\n \n googletag.display(\"mobile-article-ad-5\");\n \n });\n \n // Initial load (before ad refresh)\n \n setTimeout(() => {\n \n const ads = document.getElementsByClassName('content-page-ad');\n \n ads.forEach(ad => {\n \n ad.offsetHeight > 0 && ad.offsetHeight < 250 && ad.classList.add('center-align-ad');\n \n });\n \n }, 5000);\n \n }\n \n She said Susan had visited her shop some two weeks earlier and requested that a hand-made beaded purse like hers (Waruguru's) be ordered for her. \n \n She further said they had spoken on phone on June 28 and 29 and Waruguru informed her that the purse had been made. \n \n But the court noted that none of those who were with Waruguru on the afternoon of June 30, neither the guests nor the hosts of the alleged pre-wedding party at the PCEA church were called to testify in her defence. \n \n Waruguru said she learned about the discovery of the body early the next day as she did her chores. She said she then went to confirm the report and saw people huddled around the scene.

         "A man has been found guilty of murdering his wife. The court heard that Isaac Kirui beat and forced Damaris Kibe to take poison. Kirui was convicted by High Court judge Justus Bwonwonga after the prosecution proved he committed the offence. He will be sentenced in two weeks' time. Kirui was charged in 2013. The prosecution called five witnesses in the case. Lucy Ntutu, their landlord, testified that the two lived together in a one-room house as husband and wife. Damaris's body was found covered with a blanket in bed. A postmortem revealed that her stomach had semi-digested material with tiny white particles. Pathologist Titus Ngulungu said the mucosa in the genito-urinary system appeared hemorrhagic. And her head had a bruise. The cause of death was due to chemical poisoning and gastritis. The large bruise at the back of the head was due to blunt trauma, he said. Organophosphate pesticide was found in the samples sent to the government analyst. The chemical is used to kill pests. When ingested by humans, it blocks neuron transmission and causes paralysis of the heart and lungs, leading to death. During cross-examination, Ngulungu said the poison was orally administered. \"Usually, people who commit suicide do not have other injuries. According to the doctor, the injuries suggested forced ingestion and the injury on the body of the deceased was inflicted before death,\" he said. Douglas Angima, the security assistant at the residence, said Damaris told him she had disagreements with her husband and needed their help. He waited for his chairman to return so they could help. By the time the chairman came back, however, the woman had died. Police officer Thomas Mwinga said he was informed of a fight at 7am. He then proceeded to the crime scene where he found Damaris dead. Kirui was on the spot and had a bottle of insecticide. He told the officer Damaris had poisoned herself. He was taken to a police post. \"A group of people wanted to beat the accused. As a result, the officer took him to their office. There was a curtain sheet that divided the one-room house into a bedroom and a sitting room, which was bloodstained,\" Mwinga said. In his defence, Kirui had said the deceased was his girlfriend. He said that on November 3, 2013, he went to Transmara West to bring roofing grass. As he returned, he got a call from Damaris. She was crying but declined to explain her problem, he said. On reaching his house, he found Damaris, who, he said, appeared drunk. He said she worked at Equator Pub. He went to bed. At about 3am, the accused woke up and cried again saying she was dying. He tried to assist her but she fell down and got injured, Kirui said. The judge disagreed. He said the postmortem report disclosed that she died after poisoning and attack. \"In the circumstances, I find that the evidence discloses murder and not manslaughter,\" he ruled. \"The upshot of the foregoing is that I find the accused is guilty of murder and therefore convict him of murder contrary to Section 203 as read with Section 204 of the Penal Code.\" (Edited by F'Orieny)",

On Thursday, Kericho High Court Judge Lady Justice Mumbi Ngugi ruled that there was sufficient evidence proving the accused committed the offense. The prosecution put on the stand seven witnesses to prove the case. The prosecution told the court that the two are said to have been married for more than 21 years but on the fateful day, the accused and his late wife had arrived home from church.

         "A former university student has been found guilty of killing his lover.Marcel Jumanne Dalance, who is awaiting a probation report before sentencing, was found to have had a hand in the death of Faith Vicky Owuor on the night of July 10 and 11, 2014 in Juja.Dalance and Vicky were First Year students at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). The two shared a room in Alpha House – one of the many hostels outside the campus.It was here that Vicky died in a fire her lover claimed was caused by an electrical fault. Dalance's alibi was that he was with two friends when the incident occurred.But this was no accident as shown by an SMS Vicky sent her friend Mildred Owando, a Fourth Year student at the University of Nairobi.“Tables zimeturn (the tables have turned) Marcel and I are done for good. Wha, vitu zimekuwa moto, nitakwambia story, anataka kuniua (Wah, things are hot! I will tell you the story, he wants to kill me),” she texted Owando.This was a vital thread in the prosecution's case that compelled Justice James Wakiaga to find that Dalance was linked to Vicky's death.\"The victim's dying declaration further proved circumstantial evidence linking the accused to the death and irresistibly point to his guilt. I have looked at the accused person's defence in which he attempted to raise an alibi defence to the effect that he was not with the deceased at the time when the fire broke out and that he only came back and found the room on fire.\"However, it is clear from the evidence tendered that the accused was unable to account for his whereabouts from 10pm, when he parted ways with defence witnesses two and three,” ruled Justice Wakiaga.The State called 13 witnesses, who included fellow students and Vicky's relatives. It was police investigator E Mwangangi's testimony that the suspect's account of what happened did not add up.The court heard that Dalance told Mwangangi that Vicky's mobile phone got burnt yet he still had it. The suspect claimed he had left his lover making tea yet the kettle was not on, and a gas cylinder had not exploded.The investigator also determined that the position of Vicky's body showed she had not attempted to escape from the burning room. This, he concluded, meant she had been killed before the room was set on fire.",

         "A man found guilty of murdering his fiancee got relief after the Court of Appeal in Kisumu reduced his life sentence to 25 years. A three-judge bench upheld the conviction of Enock Akoko but instead sentenced him to 25 years as from 2015, the year he was convicted. Akoko was found guilty of murdering Janet Awuor, a Maasai Mara University student on the night of September 19, 2014 at Highway Complex Lodge in Migori county. Akoko's age -- 35 -- and the mitigation showing he had been remorseful for the five years he has spent in custody were considered in the ruling. \"Accordingly, whereas we dismiss the appeal on conviction, we nonetheless allow the appeal on sentence. In lieu of the sentence, the appellant shall serve imprisonment term of 25 years,\" Justice Patrick Kiage ruled. Through his lawyer, Akoko argued his earlier conviction and life sentence were wrong as the court relied on the evidence of a single witness. On September 20, 2014, the deceased, 19 years, travelled to Migori town in the company of her boyfriend and spent the night with him at the Highway Complex Lodge. Her dead body was found in the hotel's room on the morning of September 22, 2014 by the hotel's manager who was on duty. On close observation of the body, she noticed a stab wound on the neck and traces of blood around the nose and the mouth. She headed toward the room after noticing flies and a foul smell emanating from one of the rooms drew her attention. She called the receptionist. The receptionist revealed that a man, who had only identified himself as Otieno O. had booked the room on September 19, 2014. When asked for his identity card, he told her that he had forgotten it but he gave her an ID number Items found in the room included a leather bag, syringes, empty alcohol bottles and other personal belongings of the deceased. Police officers were notified of the dead body and afterwards traced the accused person and arrested him. An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was severe bleeding in the chest cavity caused by a penetrating lung injury. In his defence, Akoko said that although he knew where the lodge was, he did not sleep there at any time. His father, however, testified that a day before the incident, Akoko had brought a woman at home, had supper and thereafter left, saying they were going to spend the night in town. \"He (Akoko) admitted he knew the deceased as his fiancee. He recalled that the last time he was with her was in August 2014, when her father caused them to be arrested when he found them in his house,\" court documents read. Edited by E.Kibii",

         "Gavel on desk [Courtesy] A 47-year-old woman who was found guilty of killing her neighbour over allegations of having an affair with her husband has been sentenced to 10 years in prison. Agnes Cherono was convicted of killing Margaret Kobilo on December 15, 2014, at their home in Chegilet, Iten in Uasin Gishu County after hitting her with a jembe before dumping her body in a nearby millet farm. During the delivery of the sentence, High Court judge Eric Ogola warned that no one should take the law into his own hands. \"The accused may have been provoked by allegations that the deceased was having an affair with her husband. However, the accused had no right to kill the deceased on that ground. Nobody should take the law into their hands and get away with it. This court must send a clear message that life is sacred, and anybody who takes away life shall be punished,\" stated Justice Ogola. After spending six years in remand prison, Cherono had in July this year sought a plea bargain agreement with the prosecution to have her murder charges reduced to manslaughter. She told the court that although she caused Kobilo's death, she did not plan or intend to kill her. The court heard that on a fateful night, at around 8 pm, Cherono had appeared at her neighbour's door, knocked on the door and when the deceased opened it, she attacked her, hitting her with a jembe. Cherono accused Kobilo of befriending her husband and breaking her marriage. The court heard that after hitting the deceased, Cherono pulled her out of the house and dumped her on a nearby farm. Kobilo was later identified by neighbours who rushed her to a nearby dispensary but succumbed to her injuries. A postmortem report from Iten County Hospital tabled in court as an exhibit showed that the deceased died of excessive haemorrhage. After the plea bargain was accepted by the court, Cherono through her lawyer told the court that she was remorseful and that she was a mother of eight children who depended on her. The prosecution submitted that the accused was a first offender with no previous criminal record while recommending up to 10 years imprisonment or two years' probation. The court however ruled out the probation request after the pre-sentence report showed that the victim's family was still bitter with the murder of their kin. \"I have considered the mitigation. The crime which was committed by the accused is heinous. However, although the punishment for manslaughter is life in prison, I have accepted the mitigation by the accused's counsel. The accused is hereby jailed to serve a term of 10 years in prison from the date of arrest,\" ordered Justice Ogola.

         "A man who was on Tuesday found guilty of killing his wife over Sh8,000 has been jailed for 12 years. Albert Odhiambo Odongo killed his wife Eunice Atieno Olal in Homa Bay. Prosecutor Valerie Ongeti told the court that Odongo committed the offence at Kotieno village in Kasipul Constituency on June 7, 2015. Odongo had been accused of killing the wife after disagreeing over the money. He accused the wife of stealing the cash. The court heard that after the disagreement, Odongo left home for an alcohol den. He later returned home with two men with whom he assaulted Eunice and killed her at the scene. One of the witnesses Evaline Akoth testified that Odongo and his group also assaulted her when she tried to defend Eunice. \"The following day, I was informed that Eunice had died,\" Akoth said. Ongeti told the court that Odongo lied to the police that his wife had been killed by unknown criminals. \"A report from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations indicates that Odongo lied to police yet they had killed his wife in the bedroom,\" Ongeti said. The case was later changed from murder to manslaughter after the court established that Odongo did not intend to kill his wife. Four witnesses testified in the case. Odongo denied the charge before High Court judge Joseph Karanja in Homa Bay. The judge said the evidence adduced by the witnesses was adequate to prove that he committed the offence. \"You have been sentenced accordingly but you have 14 days to appeal,\" Karanja said. Odongo pleaded for leniency on grounds that he married another wife after Eunice's death and the woman left him with children after they disagreed. \"I plead for leniency because I am the one who is taking care of my children because their mother disappeared after we disagreed,\" Odongo said. He was taken to Homa Bay Prison. Click here for the latest political news.",

         "A seemingly open-and-shut case where a man confessed to murder took a twist after he recanted his testimony but the court upheld his conviction. POO drove himself to Buruburu police station on the morning of June 9, 2015 and repeatedly told the officer at the desk, \"Nimeua bibi yangu.\" He had used the chord of an iron box to strangle her to death. Calm, composed and oblivious of the implication of the confession, the man asked the officer to come with him to his Phase 5 house to see the body of his wife, AMM, lying in the store, cold, and the iron box chord still on the neck. His narrative in court suggests that he felt justified to strangle his wife of close to five years to death. The man said AMM was his second wife, being a polygamous man. But the wife grew adulterous, bringing disease in the family. Court testimony from witnesses show that AMM had increasingly normalised engaging in sex outside her marriage with multiple men and had even let her husband know. She promised to change but indulged again and again. On June 8, 2015, she had gone to meet her ex-boyfriend at his house in Kahawa Sukari to revive the fading embers of their romantic relationship. The ex-boyfriend was her college sweetheart but she had ditched him for POO, who was then the director of the college. The husband tracked her down and as was often the case, she had one explanation or another. The ex-boyfriend told the court that while they were together, AMM repeatedly received calls from POO outside the house but appeared restless and fearful. He did not know something awful was afoot. Put on his defense, POO testified that he was a hotelier by profession, owned a hospitality college which he co-directed with AMM and that he was married with two families, the first one starting in 1998. POO claimed that before eventually killing his wife, they had three confrontations. \"When he had pain urinating and was tested, he was informed that he had gonorrhoea, which the doctor informed him was sexually transmitted. He confronted the deceased, who admitted that she was in another relationship. \"Prior to this, the deceased had lied to him that she had gone to the salon, but had come home without getting her hair done. \"A few days later, he started feeling discomfort in his urine. The second scenario took place some months later, when he had the same disease diagnosed, and the third was when he started experiencing severe diarrhoea and when they went to the hospital, they both tested positive for HIV.\" The third confrontation is the one that led to the killing, he said. On the fateful day, he came back home from work at 1pm, finding his wife not there. She would not pick his calls and when she eventually did, she claimed she had gone to Eastleigh to buy some clothes. But when he eventually met her, she had no clothes that she bought and \"upon questioning her further, she told him she had gone to meet a friend, apologised and promised not to leave house without telling him\". He said they went back to the house and after dinner, they showered together and went to bed. \"When he asked for his conjugal rights, the deceased became wild and told him that she had been intimate with a young man during the day and that caused them to have an argument. \"He then began packing her clothes, and told her he would take her to her parents,\" the court papers read. At the end of the trial in March 2019, the court convicted him of the murder and sent him to 20 years jail. On appeal, the man changed his story, denying he ever confessed and insisting on his innocence. He suggested that AMM had committed suicide after he told her that he would return her to her parents. The judges, in a June 9, 2023 decision, the Court of Appeal affirmed his conviction and sentence.",

         "A man who killed his wife by throwing a burning stove on her has been sentenced to 20 years in prison. John Mathenge, 31, was convicted by Nanyuki Resident Judge Mary Kasango who noted that the prosecution had proved beyond doubt that the accused murdered his wife after a beer drinking spree. Mathenge had asked the court to hand him a non-custodial sentence saying that he was remorseful, was now a born again Christian and would never touch alcohol in life. \"The court has noted that you are remorseful but the trauma you subjected you son who was only aged three unimaginable trauma. The family of the deceased and the community is still bitter with your action,\" said Justice Kasango before announcing the sentence. Mathenge had been charged with the murder of his wife Mary Wanjiku Kanyi on December 11, 2015 at Likii Estate, Laikipia County. The court heard how on the night of the material day, Mathenge came to the house drunk, started insulting his wife while demanding for food but refused to eat when served and instead went to bed. After two hours of sleep, he woke up and went to the table room where he lit a paraffin cooking stove. When the wife followed him to find what he was up to, Mathenge threw the burning stove at her, causing 63percent burns on her body. Wanjiku died at Nanyuki Teaching and Referral Hospital, 48 days after admission. Mathenge was convicted on January 30 this year but was not sentenced then after the court asked the children's officer to prepare a report on the possible effects the death of the mother could have had on the only child who had witnessed her mother being attacked with a burning stove. \"When asked about the whereabouts of his mother is, he responded that she had gone to heaven while his father had been taken away by police officers,\" part of the report from the children's department. Justice Kasango directed that as Mathenge serves the sentence, the Laikipia Probation Office and the prison authorities subject him to anger management programmes. The court also ruled that the boy who is now aged five be enrolled in a counselling programme to assist him over trauma that has contributed in poor performance in school.",

         "A man who is on the run for allegedly stabbing his girlfriend to death may have planned the crime, according to friends who also suspect he was secretly married to another woman.\n\nCharity Mukami, 24, was allegedly killed by Martin Kunguru in Nairobi’s Nyayo Estate in Embakasi.\n\nHer body was found almost a week later after several attempts to reach her failed.\n\nAccording to her parents, when she left their home in Tassia estate on December 15, they assumed it was just a routine visit to her boyfriend, since she had not carried a change of clothes. This was the last time she was seen alive.\n\nThe Nairobian has now learnt that Kunguru could have plotted to murder Charity, his lover of two years after their affair went south according to her parents and friends.\n\nOne of the witnesses who spoke to The Nairobian on condition of anonymity claims to have overheard the suspect’s close friends in Nyayo Estate saying Kunguru had sworn to one day kill her girlfriend.\n\nThe deceased’s mother, Teresia Njeri, told The Nairobian that, “They were really not in a stable relationship. In fact, he (Kunguru) attacked her in November and came to apologise in our house.” She added that, “Though he kept off the matter following our warning and advice that he ought to get serious with Charity, including introducing his parents to the family as early as January, he was seen around the estate looking for her.”\n\nThe two met two years ago while working for popular beer company along Thika Road, according to Njeri.\n\nBut after falling in love, Kunguru reportedly urged her to quit the job go into business with him.\n\nWhen she left their home on the material day, her mum was not worried. Besides, as the mother recalls, Charity “called to say she was well and that she will be joining the family for supper. But we became worried when her phone went unanswered. After several attempts, her boyfriend’s phone went through and he claimed that he had bid Charity bye earlier.”\n\nCharity’s mother added that, “I remember telling him that he has killed my daughter when he later told me that Charity had left his house earlier that evening.”\n\n\nWith all the calls going unanswered, Njeri got in touch with the suspect’s mother, who promised to call Kunguru and find out if he had done anything to Charity.\n\nWhen Kunguru’s mother visited her son’s three-bedroom house in Nyayo Estate, she claimed not to have heard or seen anyone until the following day.\n\nCharity’s mother recalls that, “On December 22, I received a call from Kunguru’s mother who broke the sad news after the son’s house was broken into by police following the foul smell of a decomposing body that made neighbours suspicious.”\n\nThe body of Charity, who was the second-born in their family, was found in the bedroom covered in blood. There were signs of a struggle in the room.\n\n“Her old mobile phone was on the floor, but it was crushed. Her SIM card was in her new mobile phone and was charging from a bedside socket, proof that it could have been a premeditated murder,” said Njeri.\n\nThe deceased, according to the mother who was among the first to see her body, said her daughter was stabbed six times in the neck and stomach.\n\nPost-mortem results indicated that the fractures on her limbs were inflicted by a blunt object. There were documents in the house indicative that Kunguru could have been married to another woman.\n\nBeatrice Nyambura, Charity’s sister, described her as loving and hard-working.\n\nEfforts to trace Kunguru who is still on the run are yet to bear fruits. His phone has been switched off and his family claims that he has not reached out to them or made contact.\n\n“We want justice for our daughter. We are hopeful that it will be so since police investigating the matter” said a distraught Njeri.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

His lawyer asked for a bond hearing which will be considered during the mention.\n\nCOURT DELAY\n\nMr Charles Kioko, a brother of the deceased, had on Monday contacted Nairobi News to raise concerns on the delay to arraign the suspect in court.\n\nBuruburu DCIO Jeremiah Ikao confirmed to Nairobi News that there was a hitch on Monday morning that had prompted the delay. The suspect was later arraigned  at Makadara law courts but the magistrate said the murder case could only be handled by the high court.\n\nThe deceased is said to have been a gifted athlete who played football in the school’s team and was also a member of the Redeemed Gospel Church Mathare football team.\n\nShe will be buried in Sagana, Machakos county, on February 20, 2016.",

But on January 7 Chelele was found murdered, and her body dumped outside her house in Kapkwen, Bomet county.The state dropped charges against Chemutai while directing that officer Eric Musila remains in custody. State counsel Catherine Mwaniki said all witnesses come from Bureti and it would be economical to conduct the trial nearby. Musila has failed to take a plea twice as a mob attempted to lynch him while he was being escorted to prison. Musila's lawyer Wameyi Makomeri yesterday said he is uncomfortable with the case sittings being held in Nakuru, Naivasha or Eldoretfor security reasons. The case will be mentioned on December 16.",

         "A 21-year-old university student who went missing together with her boyfriend during a hiking expedition in Mt Kenya close to a year ago has been found dead. The decomposed body of Ms Yvonne Mwendwa was found in Mt Kenya Forest by game wardens on Friday, ending an 11-month search.\n\nMs Mwendwa’s mother, Ms Jadrine Kanyua, said they were contacted by authorities and they confirmed that the body was that o her daughter.\n\n“It is true. We were informed and I saw the body,” said Ms Kanyua. The student at Kirinyaga University in Nyeri County disappeared together with her boyfriend, 22-year-old musician Dennis Kirimi, while hiking Mt Kenya on September 30 last year.\n\nKenya Wildlife Service (KWS) Senior Warden Simon Gitau confirmed that only one body was found as the whereabouts of Mr Kirimi remained unknown.\n\n“My officers reported only finding one body and the crime scene investigators from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations were called in for further probe,” said Mr Gitau. “We still do not know about the whereabouts of the man but the matter is being handled by police.”\n\nThe cause of death of the student however remains unknown as Mr Gitau said a further study of the body would reveal more information. Investigations had initially pointed at a suicide pact or a possible abduction but detectives were yet to find conclusive information on what transpired. An extensive search led to the discovery of a suicide note in a hostel in Kerugoya, Kirinyaga County, that the two reportedly shared. The note would become a contentious lead into the investigation of their disappearance with the deceased’s mother disputing that her daughter was the author of the note despite it bearing her name.\n\nMs Mwendwa’s friends also doubted that she wrote the note, saying the handwriting was not hers.\n\nFriends and relatives of the two said the couple had left Kirinyaga to hike Mt Kenya but never returned.\n\nMr Livingstone Kirimi, the father of Mr Kirimi, told the Nation that his son told him he was going to Chuka, in Tharaka-Nithi County, to shoot a video but eventually pass through Kerugoya. “I cannot say more but I’m glad that she has been found. I am at peace now,” said Ms Kanyua at the weekend.\n\nOn the fateful day, a taxi driver they had hired told wardens that they had asked him to wait for them. \n\n  ",

         "Residents of Pesi Village in Laikipia West were Monday morning shocked to find a decomposing body of a woman in a maize plantation. The body of 22-year-old Grace Wamaitha was discovered after a dog came home carrying a human arm. Ms Wamaitha went missing several days ago only for her headless and mutilated body to be found in a neighbouring maize plantation. \"My dog returned home carrying a bone and after keenly inspecting I noticed it was human arm. I called my friends and we followed the path where the dog had come from only to bump on the decomposing body of the woman,\" said Mr Erick Karanu an area resident. \"We raised the alarm that attracted other villagers and police officers from Pesi Police Patrol Base who arrived at the scene,\" he added. The dead woman's head was also discovered a few metres from the scene. SUSPECT ARRESTED Police officers rescued a man who had been living with the woman from the irate residents who baying for his blood, accusing him of killing the woman. It was reported that the suspect, a farmhand, had eloped with the woman, forcing her out of her former marriage and has since July been cohabiting with her. Another man, Mr John Njama, who was earlier married to the deceased woman said that they separated after he discovered that she was having an affair with another man. \"We separated with her after noticing that she was having an extra-marital affair with the man. She at some point attempted to set my house ablaze after warning her over the issue,\" said Mr Njama. EMBRACE NYUMBA KUMI Nyahururu OCPD Ezekiel Chepkwony said they are holding the suspect as they continue with investigations. The police boss said that preliminary investigations revealed that the woman could have been killed inside their house before her body was dump in the maize farm. \"The bloody clothes and signs of commotion inside their house is evidence that the woman could have been killed inside the house. We have launched investigations to establish when the incident occurred,\" he said. Mr Chepkwony challenged members of the public to embrace the Nyumba Kumi initiative to ensure that they are able to identify the families living around them in order to deal with conflicts before matters go out of hand.",

According to sources, Roho Fweny Church priest Elisha Ogolla, 57, had been in an illicit affair for a while with Linnet Onyango, 40, a mother of six. Local Chief Ambrose Ogema said a woman who had gone to seek spiritual counsel from the pastor sounded an alarm after she saw blood flowing from his house. \"The deceased had gone to the priest's rented house at around 2pm. It seems they (lovers) had a quarrel before the priest brutally murdered the woman and mutilated her genitals,\" said Mr Ogema. Neighbours broke into the house and found the pastor gasping for air in the sitting room and Onyango's mutilated body lying on the floor. The priest died at Usenge beach while being taken to Usenge Police Station.

We suspect he might have taken poison after killing the woman,\" said the chief. He further added that the priest might have drugged the woman before killing her since the neighbours did not hear any commotion from the house. The administrator said that the duo had an illicit affair and the church was in the process of discussing their illicit affairs and possibly discipline the errant priest. Mr Ogema added that he had earlier received complaints from the woman's husband who claimed that the priest was having an affair with his wife thus breaking their marriage. \"The relationship between the two was well known in the village and it had raised a lot of eyebrows to the extent of the woman and her husband being in a tense relationship,\" said Mr Ogema. Bondo OCPD Paul Kiarie confirmed the incident stating that the bodies have been moved to the Bondo sub-county hospital for postmortem. ALSO READ: Man who exposed police killings in Nakuru executed Mr Kiarie added that they have launched probe on the matter as a way of determining the priest's actions.

         "Leaders in Taita Taveta county have linked the Tuesday incident in which an elderly woman was brutally gang-raped and subsequently murdered to ritual killing. The leaders who included three members of the Taita-Taveta County Assembly asked the police to thoroughly investigate the killing of Diana Mkandoe Maganga, 70 claiming similar bizarre incidents had occurred in the area. Speaking to The Standard in Wundanyi town yesterday, the MCAs among them Raymond Mwangola (Wundanyi-Mbale Ward), and two Nominated County Representatives Ruth Ilao and Rachael Dawai claimed the deceased private parts were removed by her killers. They at the same time claimed that a postmortem examination conducted at Wesu Sub County Hospital found out that the deceased eyes were also gorged out. \"The postmortem examination conducted in our presence revealed that the deceased private parts were removed and eyes gorged out at that is why we are linking the incident to ritual killing,\" claimed Ms Ilao, a relative to the deceased. Mr Mwangola claimed there were several other similar incidents that had occurred in the area. \"Two months ago, a similar incident occurred at Mgange-Nyika where a youth was killed in mysterious circumstances,\" said the ODM legislator. READ MORE Mwatate elderly woman raped and murdered in cold blood Man sentenced to death for robbing, raping neighbours Kakamega man sentenced to death for defiling daughter He noted in one of the recent incident, a primary school girl was murdered at Marungu village in Wundanyi constituency and her private parts removed. \"These rising incidents are disturbing and police should thoroughly investigate the alleged cases of ritual killings in the area before they go out of hand,\" noted Mwangola Ms Dawai who is also the county assembly Deputy Minority leader concurred with her counterparts saying there is need for state agencies to investigate the matter. \"There is need for the relevant stakeholders to work together to adequately address the rising cases of rape, defilement and sodomy,\" said the opposition legislator. Dawai blamed the increased rape incidences to cultural decay among the local community. Ms Maganga's decomposing naked body was dumped in a forest in the county. Police and relatives said the undressed body was found at Iyale forest near Lushangondyi Primary School in Taita Sub County. Her tattered clothes were found scattered at the scene where the body was discovered. Her killers could have robbed her of unknown amount of money, mobile phone among other valuables, said the police and relatives. According to the police and relatives the deceased went missing last Friday and her decomposing body found by villagers on Tuesday evening. The deceased hailed from Shagha village in Wumingu location, Taita Sub County. \"The incident is brutal and barbaric. I have never seen such a thing happening in the area,\" said the deceased last born son Nicholas Mwakio at the Wundanyi Police Station where the family recorded a statement. Mr Mwakio who is a tour consultant in Mombasa said his brother in-law and sister offered her mother a boda boda to take her to her destination but declined. \"After she declined to board a boda boda I gave her Sh 1,500 for use at home,\" said the deceased son in-law Rophus Mwakanyi. He said the deceased had visited them at Murugua village in Bura location, Mwatate Sub County last week. \"The deceased had visited us following the death of one of our relatives and on Friday she left for her matrimonial home where she did not reach,\" he said. \"We told her to board a boda boda but she declined. She wanted to go on foot to Wesu Sub County Hospital to see a patient before going back home where she did not reach,\" maintained Mr Mwakanyi who is also a primary school teacher in the area. Speaking to The Standard in Wundanyi town on Wednesday, Mr Mwakio said they had reported the deceased disappearance to the police after she did not reach home where a search for her started. \"We dispatched a search party from Bura and Wumingu locations to look for her since Saturday in vain,\" she said. Mwakio said on Tuesday, a woman who went to answer a call of nature in the forest found the naked decomposing body and alerted police and villagers. \"We went to the scene and identified the body of our mother. Police later removed and took the body to the hospital mortuary,\" he said. Mwakio said police recovered two abandoned underpants believed to be of her mother's killers. \"My mother was in good health when she left home last week to visit his son in law's family. We believe she was raped and murdered. Police should conduct thorough investigations into the cause of death,\" he said. Taita OCPD Benjamin Muhia confirmed and said investigations into the incident had been launched. \"We suspect the deceased was first raped before she was murdered. Postmortem examination will however determine the actual cause of death,\" the police officer told The Standard on the phone.",

         "A 20-year-old jilted man has been arrested for the brutal killing of his estranged lover.Police say the suspect killed Rose Owuor by severing her head on Tuesday evening in Ingobor, Nakuru, after she turned down his marriage proposal. Witnesses told The Standard that the man had been pestering Rose to marry him, an offer she turned down.Confirming the incident, Nakuru police boss Joshua Omukata said Rose had several wounds on her hand, face and legs.Omukata said after killing the woman, the suspect attempted suicide by taking poison and was rushed to Mother Kevins Hospital in Kaptembwo.Habel Jackton, a neighbour, said he heard cries of help at around 6pm from the house and went to check but found the door locked.Jackton said he later heard from locals that the suspect had killed a woman.Ingonor Location Chief Rashid Abdala said he received a report from members of Nyumba Kumi initiative informing him of the crime.Abdala said he informed police officers from Kaptembwo Police Station and accompanied them to the scene where they found Rose lying dead in the house.The suspect sat outside the compound.\"Locals informed me that the woman had been invited by the suspect to the house but after unknown dispute, he killed her. I rushed to the scene and was shocked to find her lying dead,\" said Abdala.According to the chief, the man informed officers during interrogation that he wanted to marry the woman but she turned down his request.He claimed that because he had spent a lot of money wooing her into a relationship that lasted several months, he decided to kill her in cold blood.\"The suspect said he has been giving the woman gifts, and when she turned down his offer of marrying him he decided to kill her,\" he said.",

         "The body of a 12-year-old girl who went missing on Saturday evening was found dumped near a river in Getare, Kisii town. The family of the orphaned girl, Cynthia Mayaka, had searched for the Standard Six girl for the better part of Saturday night only for them to find her body yesterday morning. Residents suspected that the girl might have been defiled before being murdered. The body lay in a pool of blood. The girl had been living with her grandmother following the death of her parents years ago. The grandmother had sent her to buy milk from a neighbour but she failed to return home. The family said the victim left home around 4pm on Saturday with a two-litre can to buy milk but they grew worried when she failed to return by 7pm. The body was found by an elderly man cutting napier grass on his farm on Sunday morning. ALSO READ: Saving women from domestic violence Kisii nominated MCA and anti-gender-based violence activist Risper Kemunto said rape and other forms of gender-based violence were on the rise in the area. \"Opinion leaders and politicians are quiet when it comes to violence in the home,\" she said. Kisii County Police Commander Agnes Mudamba said her officers had initiated investigations into the killing. \"Our officers will remain vigilant and ensure that everybody involved in the crime is apprehended,\" she said. Sources who sought anonymity said the girl had told one of her aunts that two young men had been following her whenever she went to a nearby spring to fetch water.",

         "A middle aged man has been sentenced to 20 year imprisonment for killing his pregnant wife. Geoffrey Olero was found guilty of murdering his wife identified as Linda Olero at their Koluoch Village home, Kadumo East Location in Rachuonyo East Sub County on January 18, 2017. ALSO READ:\n \n High profile murders come back to haunt Muhoro The Judgment was read by Justice Joseph Karanja on behalf of his colleague Hellen Omondi. Ms Omondi concluded that the matter was manslaughter rather than murder. \"I am convinced that the accused thought this was a way of disciplining the lady but it resulted to death. In my opinion this qualifies to be manslaughter,\" said Justice Omondi. All the five prosecution witnesses who testified in the case implicated Olero. Joshua Okoth who had inherited the Olero's mother said the accused told him that he was fighting with the wife when she got injured. Avoid fake news!

When I opened the kitchen door, I found wife lying dead on the floor,\" said Okoth. Felix Ongae, the Olero's maternal uncle had told the court that the accused sought protection at his home after disagreeing with his wife. He added that the lady had failed to get up after he had slapped her. Doctor Peter Ogola who conducted postmortem at Rachuonyo South Sub County Hospital, said Olero's wife death was caused by injuries she had sustained. Ogola indicated that she suffered injuries which caused separation of the placenta from the uterus in her womb. The heinous act occurred when Linda had a seven moth pregnancy.

There was also bruising from the brain besides injury on the trunk,\" the Doctor's report indicated. But Olero denied committing the offense saying his wife died in his absence. \"I was not at home on the day my wife died since gone to work and never returned. When I returned home, the following day, police came and arrested me claiming that I had killed someone,\" he said. But this was objected by Prosecutor Valery Ongeti who argued that the evidence given by other witness could convince an ordinary person that the accused killed his wife. The accused has 14 days to appeal.",
